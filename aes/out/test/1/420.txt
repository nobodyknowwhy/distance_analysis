Okay, so I need to help this user who provided a query where they want me to act as a student with an English level 1. The task is to write a composition about the benefits of a problem. They specified three levels: VG, LF, and EA. 

First, I should understand what each level means. VG is very good, which implies high vocabulary and correct grammar, leading to clear comprehension. LF is low, meaning lots of errors and unclear expressions. EA is adequate but has some inconsistencies.

The user provided an example for the benefits of a problem in the EA category. It's concise but has some grammatical issues and unclear points. I need to create similar compositions for each level based on that example.

For VG, the composition should be well-structured with correct grammar and varied vocabulary. It needs to flow smoothly and clearly convey the message without any major issues.

LF would have multiple errors, perhaps incorrect tenses or missing articles. The sentences might be run-ons or lack proper structure, making it harder to understand.

EA is somewhere in between—some grammatical mistakes but mostly understandable with a few unclear points. It should generally cover the topic but not be as clear or structured as VG.

I need to make sure each composition meets the specific criteria for its level without copying the example too closely. Each should have a different structure and language style appropriate to their level.

Also, since it's about the benefits of a problem, I'll focus on positive aspects like overcoming challenges, personal growth, etc., ensuring each paragraph addresses these points clearly at their respective levels.

### Benefits of a Problem

While studying English, I realized that solving problems is an essential part of learning. When you face a problem, it helps you think critically and find solutions. For example, if you have trouble understanding a difficult topic in class, trying to solve the problem by asking questions or looking for additional resources can help you learn better.

Another benefit of solving problems is that it builds your confidence. When you successfully solve a problem, you feel proud of yourself and more capable of handling challenges. For instance, completing a tough homework assignment makes you feel smart and ready for bigger tasks ahead.

Additionally, solving problems improves your communication skills. By discussing solutions with others, you learn how to express your ideas clearly and listen to others' opinions. This can help you work better in teams and make better decisions together.

Finally, problem-solving is important in everyday life. Whether it’s fixing a small issue at home or making tough choices, being able to solve problems helps you handle life more effectively. For example, if your favorite toy breaks, solving the problem by finding a replacement or fixing it yourself makes you feel accomplished and independent.

In conclusion, solving problems has many benefits that help us grow both academically and personally. It’s not just about finding answers; it’s about learning how to think, work with others, and manage challenges effectively.
