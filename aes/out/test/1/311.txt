Okay, so I'm supposed to write an essay about the benefits of a problem. The user mentioned that as a student with English level 1, my composition should be at that basic level with grammatical errors and maybe not enough vocabulary. They provided examples for VG, LF, and EA categories.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what the topic is. Benefits of a problem—so it's about how problems can have positive aspects. Maybe like solving problems leads to growth or learning something new. But since my English is low, I should keep sentences simple.

I should start with an introduction that states the benefits without getting too complicated. Then maybe talk about how finding solutions can be good for critical thinking and personal development. Finally, wrap it up by saying even though there are problems, they have positive effects.

Wait, but in my example response earlier, I used words like "challenges" and "overcome," which might be a bit higher level. But since the user wants low-level vocabulary, maybe use simpler words: problems, solutions, helps us...

I should avoid complex sentence structures. Each idea can be its own short sentence. Maybe start with stating that problems help in finding solutions. Then mention how solving them is useful for personal growth and learning.

Let me make sure to keep it simple. Use words like "help," "solve," "useful," "growth," etc. Maybe structure the essay in three paragraphs: introduction, body (two or more sentences), conclusion.

Problem helps us solve things that can be hard at first glance. When we face a problem, finding a solution is helpful because it teaches us new skills and knowledge.

Solving problems makes us better people. It also helps us learn from our mistakes so we don’t repeat them later on.

Even though there are problems in life, they have positive effects that help us grow.
