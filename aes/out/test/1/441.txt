Okay, I need to help this student write an essay about the benefits of a problem. They mentioned their English level is 1, so they might have some challenges understanding complex structures. The composition should be around 20 sentences and use simple vocabulary.

First, I'll start with a friendly greeting to make it personal. Then, introduce the topic by explaining that everyone faces problems but seeing them as opportunities can lead to positive outcomes. Maybe mention something about how solving problems makes us stronger.

I should keep each paragraph focused on one main point. For example, the first could be about viewing problems as chances for growth, the second about how they build our skills, and so on. I'll use simple words like "think" instead of "consider," or "useful" to describe solutions.

Including examples will help make it relatable—like how solving a problem in school helped them perform better later. Encouraging the reader with something about perseverance will keep motivation high.

Finally, wrap it up by reinforcing that problems can be good and ending on an encouraging note for the future. I'll sign off warmly to make it feel like a personal letter.

Sure! Here's a simple version of the essay based on your requirements:

Hello! How are you? I hope you're doing well.

I want to talk about something important: problems. You might think that problems are bad, but they can actually be good for us! Sometimes, when we face a problem, it feels hard at first. But if we try to solve it, it helps us grow. For example, when I had trouble with math earlier, I kept trying until I finally got it. It was hard, but in the end, it helped me understand more.

Also, solving problems makes us better at thinking. When there’s a problem, like losing something or not finishing homework on time, we need to find a way to fix it. This helps our brains get stronger and faster. Plus, when we solve problems, it feels good! It gives us a sense of achievement.

Another thing is that problems teach us about ourselves. Sometimes, problems are easy for some people but hard for others. For me, I have to work harder than other kids sometimes. But even so, it makes me stronger and smarter. Problems also show us what we can do if we try our best.

So, in the end, problems are not bad. They help us grow, learn, and become better people. Do you think problems are good too?
