Okay, so I need to help modify an essay about "Distance learning" that's currently at Level 2 based on the given prompt. The user wants me to make it look like someone who's still learning English—so adding lots of syntax errors and fewer conjunctions, while also using more first-person phrases.

First, I should read through the original essay carefully. Let me see what points it covers: introduction about distance learning being popular with tech help, flexibility as an advantage, challenges like internet issues and motivation, personal opinion on its pros and cons, and conclusion about it being a new method with advantages and disadvantages.

Now, to make this look more like a student's work, I need to introduce various grammatical errors. Maybe switch some words, change tenses incorrectly, or have run-on sentences instead of using conjunctions properly. Also, replace some proper nouns or correct phrases with incorrect ones for effect.

I should use more first-person pronouns like "I," "my," and "me" to make it seem personal. Perhaps start the essay without strictly following each point as in the original, so some paragraphs might be a bit jumbled or repetitive.

Let me think about how to paraphrase each section. For example, changing "helps students attend school from home..." to something more awkward with errors. Maybe mix up some verbs and nouns incorrectly. Also, avoid using proper transitions between ideas as much as possible—so the sentences might flow less smoothly.

I should also include some examples or practical uses where appropriate but in a way that might not make complete sense because of grammatical errors. For instance, instead of saying "It opens up opportunities," maybe say "It helps you go to school where you want."

Another point is to use incorrect tenses, like using past perfect incorrectly or future tense when it's not needed. Maybe also misuse some adverbs or prepositions.

I need to ensure that the essay doesn't start with the prompt phrase but still reflects on distance learning as a whole. So maybe begin by talking about how I've heard of it without necessarily agreeing, just like in the original.

Also, check for any spelling mistakes I might make intentionally—like "flexibilty" instead of "flexibility," or mixing up some words related to technology, like "internet" instead of "internet."

I should also vary sentence structure. Instead of using compound sentences with proper conjunctions, use simpler sentences or run-ons where it makes sense but isn't grammatically correct.

In the personal opinion section, perhaps say something that sounds more like a student's honest take rather than just stating their view without depth—maybe relate it to how they personally handle work without structure.

Finally, wrap up by summarizing the main points but in an unclear way due to errors. Make sure the conclusion reflects on distance learning as having its own issues and being new, even if those sentences aren't perfectly constructed.

Okay, now I'll try putting this all together into a modified essay following these thoughts.

Distance learning has become quite popular lately. Unlike regular school classes, it allows students to study from home or another place instead of a real classroom. With technology like computers and the internet, people can learn online.

One big advantage is that students get more freedom. They can learn whenever they want and at their own pace. This is great if they have jobs or family things to take care of. Also, distance learning lets students go to schools in areas where good classes aren't available. It helps them access education that might not be easy otherwise.

But there are some problems too. One main issue is internet connection. Sometimes it's hard to talk to teachers and other students if the internet isn't working well. Another problem is motivation. Without a routine from school, it can be tough to stay focused and keep learning.

In my opinion, distance learning has its pros and cons. I think while some parts aren't as good as regular classes, it does have benefits. For example, I can study at home when I feel relaxed or do other things. But I also need to be careful with staying on track because there are no teachers or classmates to remind me to work.

Overall, distance learning is a new way of studying that has its own set of challenges and advantages. It depends on how well the student can handle this method and use it well.
