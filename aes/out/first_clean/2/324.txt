Okay, so I need to help this English learner modify an essay about distance learning by adding lots of syntax errors and including first-person phrases like "In my opinion" or using practical examples. The goal is to make it look less polished but more like a student's rough draft.

First, I'll read the original essay carefully to understand its structure and main points. It starts with an introduction about how distance learning has become popular due to busy lives and internet access. Then it lists reasons why it's common, challenges, and ends with a personal opinion.

Now, I need to add syntax errors. That means making mistakes in sentence structure, punctuation, or word choice. For example, instead of "It’s a way of studying from home," maybe say "It's to study at home." Or mix up some adverbs and adjectives.

Including first-person phrases is important too. Instead of saying "many students," I can use "I think" or "In my opinion." Maybe write something like, "This helps me because..." instead of "Because many people have busy lives."

Adding practical examples would make the essay more relatable. For instance, mention how during COVID-19, many students used online learning. Or talk about specific challenges, like dealing with distractions at home.

I should also avoid starting with the prompt phrase but integrate it naturally. Maybe say something like "In my opinion" towards the end to express personal agreement without sounding forced.

Let me go through each paragraph and adjust them accordingly. In the first sentence, maybe change "Distance learning is becoming more popular these days." to something less formal, like "I think distance learning has become super common lately."

For the introduction about busy lives, I can say, "Some people have so much stuff to do at work or family things that they need a lot of flexibility when studying." That adds variation in wording.

When talking about challenges, instead of "It’s hard to stay focused without being near a classroom," maybe write something like "I've found it's sometimes hard to pay attention because I'm not right next to the class."

Adding examples: mention how during COVID, many couldn't go back to school and had to learn online. Or note that some students prefer online classes because of their location.

I'll make sure each sentence has errors in grammar or usage. Maybe use incorrect articles ("a" instead of "an") or misuse prepositions. Also, sometimes changing words slightly but keeping the intended meaning, like using "helping me out" instead of "being helpful to me."

Throughout the essay, I'll include first-person statements about personal experiences with distance learning, such as "In my opinion, this is a great way for people who can't attend school in person."

I should also ensure that some sentences are run-ons or have misplaced modifiers. For example, instead of writing clearly separated points, combine them into one sentence unintentionally.

Finally, I'll conclude by summarizing how distance learning offers flexibility but with its own challenges and how it's beneficial for many people despite these issues. End with a statement like "In my opinion, I think distance learning is really helpful!"

Now, putting all this together step by step to create the modified essay with all these elements included.

Distance learning has become super common lately. It’s all about studying at home instead of going to school because of how busy people are with jobs or family stuff.

I think distance learning has become super common lately. Some people have so much stuff to do at work or family things that they need a lot of flexibility when studying. Also, some schools offer online classes for students who live far away from the school.

In my opinion, this helps me because it allows me to study in my own time and at home. It’s great for balancing my work or family life with my studies.

But there are challenges too. I’ve found it’s sometimes hard to pay attention because I’m not right next to the class. Also, students might have trouble finding good places to study or they might not have all the materials they need.

Despite these issues, I think distance learning is a great way for people to learn and improve their skills. It gives them more freedom and flexibility in how they study. In my opinion, this is a really helpful thing for many people who can’t attend school in person.
