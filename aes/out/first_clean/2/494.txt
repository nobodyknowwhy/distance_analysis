Okay, so I need to act as an English learner student who's supposed to modify the given essay about distance learning. The task is to make it look like someone with a low proficiency in English might write it, scoring around 1 out of 5. 

First, looking at the original essay, it's pretty clear and well-structured. To lower the score, I should add more syntax errors. That means things like missing commas, incorrect word usage, or run-on sentences. Also, reducing the use of connectives is key. Instead of using words like "Furthermore" or "Additionally," a novice might just write without them or use very few.

I should also limit the vocabulary. Maybe instead of using more complex words, someone at this level might make mistakes with their grammar and use simpler terms which could be incorrect. For example, they might say "It's hard" instead of "It can be challenging."

Adding first-person phrases like "In my opinion" or "From my experience" would make it seem more personal but also less sophisticated. The essay should have more errors in structure—maybe run-on sentences without proper conjunctions.

Including practical examples could help, but since I'm reducing the quality, maybe making up some fake examples or using incorrect ones. For instance, talking about online courses as not being real learning tools, which shows a lack of understanding.

The introduction doesn't need to start with "Distance learning has become increasingly prevalent..." It might just say something like "Distance learning is becoming more common these days," which sounds less formal and possibly introduces mistakes right away.

I should also make the essay flow poorly. Maybe start sentences without connecting words, leading into each other in a way that's confusing or lacks coherence. 

Additionally, using incorrect tenses or verb forms could show grammatical issues. For example, saying "have become" instead of "has become."

Finally, the conclusion needs to be concise and perhaps incomplete, without a strong closing thought. It should wrap up the main points but maybe not effectively.

Putting it all together: Start with a simple statement about distance learning being common now due to technology. Mention challenges like isolation without proper connectives, flexibility in studying on their own time (with possible incorrect phrasing), and say something positive but vague about how it's beneficial despite issues.

I'll make sure the essay has lots of errors, bad grammar, and a weak structure, making it look like someone just starting out would write.

Distance learning is becoming more common these days because of technology. It lets students from different places learn without traditional schools.

One problem with this method might be that they can't talk to friends face-to-face. This could make group work harder for everyone involved.

Another benefit is the ability to study when it's convenient. Some people find this helpful, especially if they have jobs or family things to do. But sometimes it feels like they're not really learning anything new at all.

In the end, distance learning can be useful but also confusing. It’s something that could work well for some, but others might still feel lost about how to handle their studies.
