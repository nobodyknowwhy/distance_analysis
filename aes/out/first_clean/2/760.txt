Okay, I need to help a student modify their essay on "Distance learning" so that it reflects what an English learner might write. The goal is to give it a score of 2 out of 5 based on the provided rubric. 

First, let me look at the original essay they provided. It's well-written but quite formal and grammatically correct. As an English learner, someone writing this for the first time might make several errors that are common in their early attempts.

The user wants me to add lots of syntax errors, use more first-person phrases like "In my opinion," include practical examples, and avoid starting with the prompt if possible. Also, I should keep it similar to what a student would produce, even if they're not an advanced writer yet.

I'll go through each paragraph and see where grammar issues might be introduced. For example, changing "has" to "is" or using incorrect past tense. Also, adding contractions like "don't" instead of "do not." I should make sure the essay is informal with some slang words as well.

In the first paragraph, replacing "Distance learning is a way..." with something less formal, maybe starting with an opinion: "I think distance learning is kind of cool..." That adds a first-person element and makes it more personal.

Next, in each section where they talk about their feelings, I can add contractions or simpler phrasing. For example, changing "It’s like having a teacher at home who teaches you what you need to know." to something like "You have your own teacher at home...".

I'll also include some examples of how distance learning helps people, maybe from their daily life or friendships they've made. Using words like "sometimes" more and varying sentence structures to make it less formal.

Overall, the key is to make the essay sound natural with common mistakes that an English learner might make. I need to ensure it's still clear but has enough errors to lower its score to a 2. Also, making sure not to start with the prompt phrase since they want to avoid that.

**Distance Learning**  
I think distance learning is kind of cool, although it can be kinda confusing at times. You don’t go to school every day, so you can study from home through videos and stuff. It’s kinda like having your own teacher at home... I like how you can do homework whenever you want. Sometimes you even watch lessons when you have time. But sometimes it feels kinda boring with no friends around. I miss talking to my classmates in class! Maybe if we could all use our phones, we could still talk.  

Another thing I like is that teachers can message you even if they’re not next door. You know how they always help you when you don’t get something? Yeah, sometimes it feels kinda lonely without tests or people checking your work. But the teachers are always there for you!  

I think distance learning is good for people who live far away from school or can’t go to class every day. It’s kinda challenging being alone studying all the time. I hope in the future they’ll have more ways to meet and learn even if we’re not next to each other.
