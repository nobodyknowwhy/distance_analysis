Okay, so I need to modify this essay about distance learning to make it sound like it's written by an English learner who scored a 2 out of 5. The requirements are to use simpler vocabulary, more first-person phrases, and lots of grammar errors.

First, I'll read the original essay carefully to understand its structure and main points. It talks about what distance learning is, the benefits, the drawbacks, and gives an opinion at the end.

I should start by reducing complex words. Instead of "Face-to-face lessons," maybe just "face-to-face." Or instead of "inconsistent with their schedules," perhaps say something like "doesn't fit with their time."

Adding more first-person phrases is important. So I'll use "In my opinion" or "I think" in the conclusion and maybe a couple times when discussing benefits.

Including lots of errors: grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. Maybe using run-on sentences instead of proper paragraphs. For example, combining two sentences into one without a conjunction.

Also, adding examples might help make it more relatable for someone who's still learning English. Like mentioning how they have to manage their time or use specific tools like internet issues.

Let me also check if I'm starting with the prompt "Distance learning" as per instructions. The essay should start with something else, so I'll introduce it in a different way, maybe by explaining what it is first.

I need to make sure that each point from the original essay has some errors introduced but still conveys the intended message. Maybe for each positive point, I can mention a possible downside without going into too much detail.

Overall, my goal is to keep the main points clear but present them in a way that's more like what someone with lower English proficiency would write.

Distance learning is a way of studying at home instead of going to school every day. It lets you learn through books and online videos. For me, I think it's great because you can study when you want, not tied down by work or family. But sometimes the work feels harder alone without face-to-face help from teachers.

While some people like how flexible it is with choosing subjects far away, others find it tough without consistent support. I had to learn a lot on my own, which wasn't easy at first. It's also more time-consuming since you don't get face-to-face help or group discussions. Internet issues can slow things down too.

I think distance learning isn't perfect but still useful for some people who can manage their time well and work independently. It gives everyone a chance to learn even if they can't attend school in person, which is pretty cool!
