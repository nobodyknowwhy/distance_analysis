Alright, I need to help this user by modifying an existing essay on "Distance Learning" so that it reflects how a beginning English learner might write it. The user wants a score around 2 out of 5, which means the essay should have several syntax errors, lack connective words, and use more first-person phrases.

First, I'll read through the original essay to understand its content and structure. It covers advantages like flexibility and accessibility, challenges such as technical issues and inequality, technological advancements mitigating some problems, broader implications on lifelong learning, and a conclusion balancing pros and cons.

Now, I need to transform this into something that sounds more like an English learner's work. That means adding lots of errors: maybe using incorrect tenses, incomplete sentences, run-on paragraphs without proper connectors. Also, including phrases like "In my opinion" or starting with personal experiences will make it more conversational.

I'll start by simplifying the language. Instead of saying "eschewing traditional classroom settings," I might say "instead of going to school." Replace "broadens access" with "makes education available."

Next, I should reduce the use of complex sentences and connectives. So instead of explaining how technology helps, maybe just state that advancements in tech solve some issues without elaborating much.

I'll also add more first-person examples, like talking about my own challenges with online learning or using personal opinions on whether it's better than traditional school.

Finally, I need to ensure the essay doesn't start with "Distance Learning" and perhaps avoid overly academic terms. I'll check each paragraph for these changes, adding errors here and there without making the sentences completely ungrammatical yet.

**How I Viewed Distance Learning**

Distance learning has been a big thing lately. It sounds cool but honestly? I don’t think I can handle it as well as they say. Instead of going to school every day, you have to stay home and study online. It’s kinda weird because I miss the classroom feeling. You know how in class everyone is together talking about stuff? Now, I’m alone with my computer. It’s not bad though; some days are better than others.

One thing that helps me with distance learning is having all my materials online. Like, when they send us books or notes, I can download them right away. That makes it easier to study at home without carrying heavy backpacks. But sometimes the classes feel boring because there’s no one around to ask questions. I miss having friends over to study with.

I also think distance learning is good for people who work or have families. It lets them keep doing their jobs while studying. But not everyone can do that, right? Some people still struggle with staying focused at home. They say they need a quiet place and a nice computer. Sometimes I forget about it though and end up getting distracted.

Another thing is the technology part. I’ve heard about all these fancy gadgets but honestly, my computer isn’t great. It freezes sometimes and doesn’t have all the features people talk about. It’s frustrating when you need to use something that’s not working. Also, not everyone has the same stuff at home. Some people don’t have good internet or a reliable device. That makes it harder for them to keep up.

But wait, I’ve heard that tech is getting better every year. Maybe next year they’ll fix those problems with my computer? I hope so because learning online is kind of hard without a good setup.

In the end, distance learning has its pros and cons. I like how flexible it is but also struggle with staying focused and having no one to talk to when I’m stuck. Maybe if I could find a better place to study or have more people around me, it would be easier. Still, it’s something new and different from normal school life.
