Okay, so I'm trying to help someone who's an English learner improve their essay on "Distance Learning." They want the essay to reflect a lower proficiency level by adding lots of syntax errors, using more first-person phrases, and including some incorrect examples. The goal is to give it a score around 1-2 out of 5.

First, I'll read the original essay provided. It's well-written but lacks many mistakes and feels a bit polished. My task is to make it look like it was written by someone still learning English.

I notice that in the first sentence: "In recent years..." could be changed to something simpler, maybe starting with an exclamation or using contractions. Also, adding more contractions for first-person could help, so I'll include phrases like "I think" and "this kind of."

Looking at each paragraph:

1. The second paragraph starts strong but has good grammar. Maybe replacing some words with contractions: "You can take courses through videos..." becomes "you can take courses through videos..." Hmm, that's already okay, but perhaps changing it to "you can take courses through videos" with a contraction.

Wait, the user wants lots of syntax errors. So I'll introduce more informal mistakes like missing articles or incorrect pronouns.

In the third paragraph about platforms: "Moodle or Zoom." Should have an article: "The platform Moodle or Zoom."

Also, in the first-person examples, maybe say "I feel sometimes" instead of "sometimes" alone. Maybe add "like" when listing things students can do online.

In the problem section: Instead of saying "distractions," I'll use a contraction like "distraction." Also, maybe start sentences with words that don't begin with capital letters or have run-on sentences without proper punctuation.

The conclusion should be more personal and include a question to invite feedback. Perhaps end with something like "Maybe distance learning is not the best for everyone, but overall..." using contractions there too.

I'll also make sure each sentence has multiple clauses connected improperly, which is common in lower proficiency writing. For example: "Sometimes teachers send messages back via email." Maybe expand it a bit incorrectly.

Another thing to note is varying the structure of sentences so they're shorter and less complex than the original. Also, including some incorrect examples, like saying "you can learn from anywhere" as "anywhere" instead of "anywhere."

I'll go through each sentence in the essay and tweak them with these ideas: adding contractions, using more informal expressions, introducing syntax errors like missing articles or incorrect pronoun usage.

Finally, I'll ensure that the overall message is clear but the writing looks less polished to reflect a lower proficiency level.

**Distance Learning: A New Way of Studying**

Lately, technology has transformed how we learn. Distance learning is now a typical method for getting education. It lets students study on their own pace without meeting others in person.

You can take courses through videos, written materials, and reading books online. Sometimes teachers send messages back via email to help with questions or give feedback. This helps them understand what the student has done well or needs to improve.

There are many platforms that offer distance learning like moodle or zoom. These tools let students join classes online. Some schools also use video conferencing for lessons.

One problem with distance learning is that students might have trouble staying focused at home because of too many distractions. Sometimes the internet doesn't work well, and devices can break down. This makes it hard to study properly.

Even though this kind of learning has some challenges, it's good because you don't need to travel far for courses. You can also go back over parts of lessons if you didn't understand something at first.

Overall, distance learning is a new way of studying that helps people learn more easily from home. But there are some problems like distractions and technical issues that students should consider when using this method.
