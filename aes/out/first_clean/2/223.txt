Alright, I need to help this user by modifying an existing essay about distance learning into something that sounds more like it was written by an English learner who might be scoring a 2 out of 5. The instructions mention adding lots of syntax errors and including first-person phrases or examples.

First, looking at the original essay: It's clear but lacks many grammatical errors and has some run-on sentences. I should add more mistakes like subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect tenses, missing punctuation, etc.

I'll start by changing some words to incorrect forms. For example, "has become" could be changed to "is becoming," creating a wrong past continuous tense. Also, adding contractions where appropriate, like using "doesn't" instead of "does not."

Including first-person pronouns will make it sound more personal and student-like. Phrases like "In my opinion" or "I think" can add that touch.

Adding practical examples is helpful because it makes the essay seem more grounded. For instance, mentioning specific tools like Zoom for virtual classrooms helps illustrate points without being too complex.

I also need to ensure there are multiple grammatical errors throughout. Maybe changing some sentences into run-ons by combining them incorrectly or using incorrect verb forms.

Finally, I'll make sure not to start with "Distance learning" as per the instructions and instead have an engaging introduction that reflects a student's perspective on the topic.

Here’s the modified essay based on your requirements:

I think distance learning is really cool but also kind of confusing sometimes. I mean, you can’t just go out and learn stuff like you normally would in class. It’s been a bit overwhelming at times because there are so many rules and things to remember. But hey, it’s also great for people who need to work while studying or maybe even for those who live far away from schools.

For one thing, I guess it gives you more freedom to do other stuff like work or help out family members. That sounds awesome! Plus, if your school is closed because of bad weather or something, distance learning lets you learn in the comfort of your home. But then again, sometimes it’s not easy staying focused without a teacher around. I mean, where do you get help when you’re stuck on a problem? Maybe you can ask friends through online platforms, but that feels a bit weird.

Another thing is that distance learning often takes place at home, which could be good for people who need to take care of family while studying. But it’s also kind of lonely sometimes. I don’t know if you feel as connected with classmates when you’re not all in the same classroom together. Maybe you can watch videos or something, but it doesn’t seem as interactive.

Overall, I think distance learning has its pros and cons. It’s interesting how flexible it is, but there are definitely challenges too. I guess it depends on how much you can stay on track without being near a teacher all the time. It might work for some people more than others, but at least it gives everyone an option to keep learning even if school isn’t open.
