Alright, I need to help this user by modifying their essay on "Distance Learning" so that it reflects a lower proficiency level in English, specifically an E2 score out of FCE. The goal is to make the essay look like something an English learner might write. 

First, I'll read through the original essay provided. It's well-structured with clear points about challenges and benefits, but it uses complex grammar and connective words. My task is to add more syntax errors, reduce connectives, use first-person phrases like "In my opinion," and include practical examples.

I should start by identifying areas where I can make the sentences simpler and more fragmented. Instead of using "Additionally" or "However," I'll replace those with transition words that might be less precise or used differently. Also, I need to avoid using advanced vocabulary; perhaps substitute some words with synonyms at a lower level.

I'll also look for opportunities to insert more first-person pronouns to make it feel more personal and student-like. Adding examples will help illustrate points without making the essay seem forced. For instance, mentioning how limited internet affected specific individuals can provide concrete instances of the challenges faced.

Next, I need to ensure that each paragraph isn't too long, breaking them into shorter sentences with fewer connectives. This will make it look choppy and less coherent from an advanced perspective. Using phrases like "In my opinion" or "For example," will add the necessary personal touches.

I should also check for common syntax errors such as missing articles, incorrect tenses, or subject-verb agreement issues. These mistakes will make the essay look more informal and less polished.

Finally, I'll ensure that the essay doesn't start with the prompt itself but instead flows naturally from a first-person perspective. This approach will help in making it seem like an actual student's draft rather than a structured response.

Distance learning has become something people use these days. It started when many couldn’t go to school because of COVID, but even before that some kids didn’t have access to schools and needed help at home.

There are problems with this kind of learning. Like sometimes the internet isn’t good or people don’t have the right tools at home. Also, not everyone has the same technology or fast internet, which can make it hard for some students.

Even though there are issues, I think distance learning is useful because you can learn from home while working or doing other things. But some say it doesn’t work as well as going to school with classes. People say they don’t feel as much support online.

Some studies think that doing the lessons online makes kids do worse. They might not get as much help like in school where teachers are always there. On the other hand, people believe it’s a good way to reach more kids and make education better for everyone.

Looking into the future, distance learning will probably get even better with new tech. Maybe some classes can be done online while others happen in person—that would be cool because you could learn from home or go to school when you want.
