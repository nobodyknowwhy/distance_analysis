Okay, so I need to help this user by modifying an essay about distance learning for an English learner score of 2 out of 5. The original essay is pretty basic but has some issues like run-on sentences and grammar mistakes. My task is to make it look more like someone just starting with English, adding lots of errors and personal phrases.

First, I'll read the original essay carefully. It mentions how distance learning changed schools because people have busy lives. Kids learn at home through videos and computers. It helps kids live far away by saving time without buses or long walks. Some say it's better than regular school, but there are problems like hard to focus without seeing teachers and classmates. Also, sometimes the computer or internet might not work, and kids miss out on opportunities at home. Overall, distance learning is helpful despite challenges.

Now, I need to add more first-person phrases like "In my opinion" or "I think." I should also introduce lots of grammatical errors—like run-on sentences, incorrect tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, missing articles, and wrong prepositions.

Let me start by expanding the introduction. Maybe say something like, "Distance learning is a thing that changed schools..." That's more personal than the original. Then perhaps add an opinion: "In my opinion, it helps students learn at home." But I need to make sure the grammar isn't correct yet.

Next section: explaining how people use it because of busy lives or sports practice. Maybe say something like, "People today are so busy with family or sports that they can’t go to school every day." That's a good sentence but needs more errors. Like adding an extra word or two without punctuation.

Then the part about saving time: "It saves time instead of waiting for buses or walking far." Hmm, maybe make it more run-on. Perhaps, "Instead of having to wait for buses and walk all day, they can study from home." That's better but needs more errors. Maybe say, "You don’t have to deal with waiting or long walks."

When talking about kids missing school opportunities due to distance, I should include an example like online classes not being as engaging or without hands-on activities. Maybe write something like, "Some people think that learning from home is better because you can study anywhere." But that's correct; need more errors.

Problems with focus: "Without seeing teachers and classmates face-to-face, it’s sometimes hard to stay on track." That's a good sentence but needs fixes. Maybe change tense or add extra words.

Internet issues: "If the computer doesn’t work or internet is slow, learning can be harder." Needs more errors like missing articles or wrong prepositions. Maybe say, "The internet might not always be fast enough."

Opportunities: "Some kids might miss out on special activities that happen at school." But make it an opinion with more errors.

Ending: Overall thoughts, saying distance learning is helpful but there are problems. Maybe phrase it as, "Overall, I think distance learning helps people learn in their own time, but sometimes it can be a bit confusing."

I should also add some filler words and incorrect tenses. For example, instead of "is," use "are" where appropriate. Use contractions like "you're" or miss articles.

Let me put all this together while ensuring each section has multiple errors to score low. Maybe make several run-on sentences without proper punctuation.

Distance learning is a thing that changed schools for the better. People today are so busy with family and sports practice they can’t go to school every day. Instead of having to wait for buses and walk all day, they can study from home. It saves time instead of waiting or long walks.

Some people think it’s better than regular school but there are problems too. For example, if the computer doesn’t work or the internet is slow learning can be harder. Also some kids might miss out on special activities that happen at school because they’re not in a physical classroom.

In my opinion, distance learning helps students learn at home but it’s sometimes confusing when you can’t see teachers and classmates face-to-face. If the computer doesn’t work or internet is slow learning can be harder. Some kids might miss out on special activities that happen at school because they’re not in a physical classroom.

Overall I think distance learning helps people learn in their own time but sometimes it can be a bit confusing.
