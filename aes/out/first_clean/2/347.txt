Okay, so I need to help this English learner modify an essay about distance learning by adding lots of syntax errors and using more first-person phrases like "In my opinion." The current score for the revised version needs to be around 2/5.

First, let me look at the original essay they provided. It's pretty good in content but probably lacks many grammatical errors since it was generated by a large language model. My task is to intentionally make several syntax and grammar mistakes while keeping some correct aspects so that the overall score stays low.

I'll start by changing some words where they don't fit, like replacing "become" with "is become." That's one mistake right there. I should also use contractions incorrectly, such as writing "don't have" instead of "do not have."

Next, I need to add first-person phrases. Instead of saying "In my opinion," maybe start the essay that way. Also, include other expressions like "I think," "this is one issue," etc.

I should mess with tenses too; sometimes use past tense where present is needed or vice versa. For example, "used" instead of "have" in some places.

Also, make sure to have incomplete sentences and run-on sentences by combining them incorrectly. Maybe write things like "Distance learning it a..." instead of "Distance learning is a..."

Replace proper nouns with similar-sounding words, such as changing "AI" to "AY" or using incorrect spellings for other terms.

I should also include errors in quotation marks; maybe forget to close them or use them incorrectly. Also, add some run-on sentences without proper conjunctions or punctuation.

Let me think of specific places where I can make these mistakes:

1. In the second sentence: "students and teachers meet at different places" â†’ change to past tense.
2. Use incorrect prepositions like "for instead of for in home."
3. Replace words with similar sounds, e.g., "distance" could stay as is, but maybe use "distant learning" wrong.

I should also make sure the essay flows poorly and seems repetitive. Maybe repeat some phrases or ideas incorrectly.

Now, let me go through each paragraph and make the necessary changes:

First paragraph: Start with "In my opinion," then talk about distance learning being popular because people are busy or have mobility issues.

Use a contraction like "I think" in another sentence and maybe mix up tenses for consistency.

Second paragraph: Mention that lessons can be taken from home, but use incorrect grammar, maybe "students take their own time without schedules."

Third paragraph: Talk about self-discipline as a challenge but mess with the structure so it doesn't make sense. Maybe say they need good internet connections despite not always being possible.

Fourth paragraph: Highlight how distance learning helps people who can't attend school due to work or family, maybe using incorrect articles or possessives.

Fifth paragraph: Talk about AI and virtual classrooms as future improvements but add fake phrases like "dynamic learning platforms."

Finally, conclude with a positive statement that's too vague, like saying it depends on teachers' adaptation.

I need to ensure the essay has several of these errors across all sections. Also, make sure it sounds like an English learner by using colloquial expressions or incorrect sentence structures.

In my opinion, distance learning is a method where students and teachers meet at various spots instead of one place together. It's become more well-known because individuals are getting too busy or having trouble moving around.

Students take their own time without schedules to study. One issue with this kind of learning is that it requires self-discipline to keep studying every day and finish assignments on time. Also, students need good internet connections for online classes.

Distance learning can help people who can't go to school because they're busy or have family issues. It gives them more time to learn things in-depth. Some prefer distance learning because it's flexible and saves money on travel to schools.

In the future, distance learning might become even better with new tech like AI and virtual classrooms. But I think it depends on how well teachers adapt to these changes. Overall, distance learning is a great way to keep education without missing out on important life events.
