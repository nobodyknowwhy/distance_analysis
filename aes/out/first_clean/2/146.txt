Okay, so I need to help an English learner modify their essay on "Distance Learning" by adding lots of syntax errors, using first-person phrases like "In my opinion," adding practical examples, and making it look less polished. The goal is for the score to be around 1 out of 5.

First, I'll read through the original essay they provided. It's well-structured but quite formal. My task is to make it sound more like someone who's just starting to learn English. So, I need to introduce a bunch of mistakesâ€”like subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect prepositions, maybe some run-on sentences without proper conjunctions.

I'll start by breaking down each paragraph and tweaking it. For example, changing "refers" to "is" because it's the base form and sounds more natural in spoken English. Also, I can add contractions where appropriate, like using "wouldn't" instead of "would not wouldn't."

In the first sentence, replacing "Distance learning refers to..." with something simpler: "Distance learning is about...". That makes sense because it's a basic structure.

Next, when they mention advantages and disadvantages, I can add phrases that reflect uncertainty or indecision. For example, using "I think" at the beginning of sentences or mixing in some contractions for variety.

I should also make sure to include examples without overcomplicating them. Maybe saying something like, "Some people might not enjoy it because..." which is a straightforward way to express a disadvantage.

Looking at sentence structure, I can combine ideas into run-on sentences without using conjunctions or commas, just using periods instead. That would show that the student isn't yet comfortable with more complex structures.

Additionally, adding some of the same phrases repeatedly could help in making it seem repetitive but still natural for a learner. Phrases like "I think" and "In my opinion" can be used multiple times to vary the writing without necessarily changing the meaning.

Overall, I'll make sure each sentence is clear but has obvious errors that a non-native speaker might make. This will help in making the essay look less polished while still conveying basic ideas about distance learning.

Distance learning is about how people study at home or through online methods, often using written materials and technology. It's become more popular because it offers flexibility to students who can't attend school regularly.

I think one big advantage of distance learning is that you can learn when you feel most comfortable. For instance, some days I find work much better than other times, so this helps me focus on my studies without worrying about the schedule. Also, since you can review lessons as many times as you need, it's helpful for understanding things again.

Another good thing is how it lets people from different places learn together. Like last semester, we had classmates from around the world who shared their experiences through online discussions. Plus, with so much information available online, students have access to more resources than before.

But I'm not sure about all the challenges distance learning brings. Some days I feel like I don't motivate myself enough and end up doing little work. It's hard to stay focused without someone telling me what to do each day.

Also, it can be tough talking to teachers and classmates because we don't see each other face-to-face. Sometimes people get stuck on questions and don't know how to ask for help. And if the internet is slow or something goes wrong with my computer, I might miss important parts of the lesson.

Despite these issues, distance learning seems useful for some students. It's good for those who can't go to school regularly because they have health problems or live far away. But it still needs better technology and support to help everyone learn well.
