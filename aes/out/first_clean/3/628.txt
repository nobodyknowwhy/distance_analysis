Alright, so I need to help this user who's an English learner modify an essay about distance learning. They want it to look like someone just starting out in English. The score is 3 on a scale of 1-5, which probably means some errors but not too bad.

First, the original essay talks about distance learning being taught online without a classroom. It mentions COVID-19 causing more people to use it, schools offering online classes, challenges like discipline and access to resources, teachers having trouble with tech, and future improvements in technology making it more popular.

The user wants me to add more syntax errors so the essay looks less polished. Also, include some first-person phrases like "In my opinion" or practical examples. No need to start with the prompt itself.

Looking at the sample modification, they made several changes: added contractions (like "can't"), used "I think," "In my opinion," and "For example." They also repeated words for emphasis, changed some words slightly, and had incorrect grammar in sentences.

So I should follow that pattern. Maybe introduce a few more errors, use more personal pronouns, add examples, and make sure the essay feels a bit choppy or repetitive to mimic a student's rough draft.

I need to ensure that each paragraph is addressed—introduction, challenges, benefits, future, etc.—and that each has some of these issues. Also, avoid making it too informal; still keep it semi-coherent but with obvious mistakes.

Let me outline the essay structure first:

1. Introduction explaining distance learning.
2. Impact of COVID-19 on its popularity.
3. Challenges faced by students and teachers.
4. Benefits despite challenges.
5. Future expectations.

Now, apply the modifications to each section, adding errors and personal touches where needed.

Distance learning is a way people learn without going to school in person. Instead of going to classes, we use computers or phones to study at home.

I think distance learning has become more common because of things like the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, many schools stopped teaching in person and moved everything online.

But I feel this can be hard work. Some people say it’s tough to stay focused on their studies every day without others around them. Maybe not everyone has access to good internet or materials at home.

Also, some teachers don’t know how to teach online properly. They might have tech problems or not get to talk as much with their students like in a normal class.

Despite these challenges, I think distance learning can help people learn better. It lets them study on their own time and sometimes helps them understand things faster because they’re not distracted by others.

In the future, I believe more people will use it since technology keeps improving. They’ll have better internet and ways to talk with teachers. So maybe less people need to go to school at all!
