Alright, so I need to help modify this essay about distance learning to make it look like it was written by an English learner at a 3rd grade level. The user provided the original essay and wants me to add more syntax errors and use first-person phrases.

First, I'll read through the original essay carefully. It's pretty clear but has some grammatical issues that a student might make. My goal is to make it sound more like someone who's still learning English—so maybe adding contractions incorrectly or using simple sentences where they could be more complex.

I'll start by identifying areas where there are errors. For example, in the first sentence: "Distance learning has become a new way of studying that many people are now using." It should probably be "has become" instead of "became," and maybe change it to present tense because if I'm making it more like an English learner who's still progressing.

I'll add some contractions, like changing "have become" to "have became." Also, the word "students" might get contracted as "they're" or something similar. I'll replace proper nouns with initials where possible, such as "Distance learning" becoming "distance learning."

Next, I need to include more first-person phrases. So instead of saying "many people," I can say "I think" or "In my opinion." I'll also use examples, like mentioning specific schools or the internet in a way that might show some understanding but with mistakes.

Looking at each paragraph, I'll make sure sentences are short and simple. For example, changing complex sentences to shorter ones with clear structure. Also, replacing words with their simpler forms where appropriate—like "make it easier" could become "is easier."

I should also add some repetitive phrases or incorrect tenses to mimic a learning process. Maybe using the wrong past tense verbs or missing articles.

In the future section, I'll make similar adjustments, ensuring consistency in mistakes and first-person usage. Also, I'll replace technical terms like "e-learning" with just "online learning."

Finally, I'll review the essay to ensure it flows naturally despite the errors and that it still conveys the intended message about distance learning's advantages and challenges.

Let me go paragraph by paragraph:

1. The first sentence: change tenses correctly and add contractions.
2. In each subsequent point, use first-person pronouns where appropriate and fix any grammatical issues.
3. Ensure sentences are short and simple, with clear examples.

By systematically applying these changes, the essay should reflect a lower proficiency level, specifically a 3 out of 5, while still conveying the main ideas about distance learning.

Distance learning has become a new way of studying that I think is becoming more popular. It's a method where students can study from home instead of going to school, which feels like a big change for me.

In my opinion, this type of learning is also called online learning or e-learning. Students can choose the time they want to study because it’s flexible. They can watch videos and listen to lessons on the internet or use computer software. Some schools offer classes online too.

One advantage I see with distance learning is that students have more freedom. They can learn at their own pace, take breaks when needed, and maybe even do better in school because of it.

But sometimes I feel like there's not enough interaction between teachers and students during online classes. It’s harder to ask questions face-to-face too. However, with technology, some schools are trying to make things better for the students.

Looking into the future, I think distance learning will become even more popular. More schools might start offering online classes, and people could use computers and the internet more for studying. Maybe it'll be as good or even better than regular schools in the future. But there’s still a lot of work to make it perfect.
