Alright, so I need to help an English learner improve their essay about distance learning by adding more syntax errors and using first-person phrases like "In my opinion." The current score is 3 out of 5.

First, I'll read the original essay carefully to understand its content and structure. It talks about the freedom of studying at home, flexibility in scheduling, global learning opportunities, and the need for self-discipline.

I should add more mistakes where someone might make a mistake. Maybe misspellings or incorrect grammar without knowing it's an error on purpose. Also, I can use phrases like "In my opinion" multiple times to make it look less formal.

I'll also include some examples, like mentioning specific countries if possible, but since the original essay doesn't specify, maybe just keep it general for now.

Let me go sentence by sentence and see where I can insert errors or add first-person elements without making them too obvious. For example, instead of saying "like traditional schools," maybe say "like in normal schools" or use a phrase like "I feel that."

I need to ensure the essay still makes sense but has enough student-like errors to lower its score from 3 to perhaps 1-2. I'll also add some incomplete sentences or run-on sentences to show more of a learning stage.

Finally, I'll wrap it up with a conclusion that's a bit repetitive but follows naturally without being polished.

**Distance Learning: A Home Schooling Experience**

Distance learning has grown in popularity these days because it permits students to study from the comfort of their homes. Unlike traditional schools where everyone is in one classroom and follows the teacher’s instructions, distance learning allows people to attend classes online. I believe this is fantastic as it helps students who can’t attend school for various reasons like health problems or family issues.

One big advantage of distance learning is that you can study whenever you want. You don’t have to wait for your turn in class or finish all your homework before going home. This flexibility makes studying easier and more enjoyable. However, I think this kind of learning also requires a lot of self-discipline because it’s hard to stay focused when you’re studying at home.

Another thing is that distance learning can help students from different places learn the same things together. For example, if my school offers online classes for other countries, everyone can study together even though they are in different countries. But I’m not sure this also depends on whether all schools around the world have good internet connections and technology.

In conclusion, distance learning is a great way to continue education from home. It gives students more flexibility and allows people to learn from anywhere. However, it still requires hard work and dedication because you can’t rely on others to keep you on track. I feel that this method of learning has its pros and cons, but overall, it’s a valuable experience for those who are willing to put in the effort.
