Okay, so I'm supposed to help an English learner improve their essay on distance learning by adding more syntax errors and using first-person phrases like "In my opinion" to make it look less polished. Let me see how to approach this.

First, the original essay is pretty basic but correct. The user wants me to add more mistakes so that a student with a lower score (like 1-3) would produce something similar. I need to think about common errors students make when writing essays—maybe run-on sentences, incorrect tenses, missing articles, or wrong prepositions.

Looking at the original essay:

"In my opinion, distance learning is beneficial because it allows people to study from home while still working or taking care of family." Hmm, that's a complete sentence. To make it a run-on, maybe connect two ideas without a comma or conjunction. For example, "In my opiniondistance learning is beneficial because it allows people to study from home while still working or taking care of family."

Wait, but starting sentences with "In my opinion" might already be considered a student mistake if they use it too much. Maybe I can adjust the structure.

Next part: "One thing about distance learning is that you need good internet and devices..." Maybe change "is that" to "that" if it's the subject. Or perhaps make the sentence incomplete, like "...you need good internet and devices to connect."

Another thought: using passive voice incorrectly or missing articles. For example, instead of "good internet," maybe write "a good internet connection" but correct that in another place.

Also, adding more first-person pronouns like "I think," "In my opinion," etc., could help. But I need to make sure it's done naturally without overdoing it.

Looking at the second paragraph: Maybe split sentences incorrectly or use incorrect tenses. For example, "It can be useful because..." instead of "is" if using passive voice.

For the third paragraph about the problems, maybe say something like "Not everyone has good internet at home," which is correct but could be made into a run-on by not adding commas or conjunctions properly.

Also, in sentences where students might use incorrect prepositions, I can replace them. Like instead of "without face-to-face interaction," maybe write "without face-to-face interactions" incorrectly as "face-to-face."

I should also consider missing articles, like "a good internet connection" instead of "good internet."

Let me try to outline how each paragraph might be altered:

1st sentence: Instead of starting with a complete thought, make it run-on. Maybe combine two sentences without proper punctuation.

2nd sentence: Change the structure so that a part is missing or incorrect tense used.

3rd sentence: Perhaps use an incorrect preposition or miss a conjunction.

4th sentence: Make a mistake in the tenses or article usage.

5th sentence: Use first-person pronouns where appropriate, but not overdo it.

I need to ensure the essay still makes sense despite these errors because it's meant to mimic lower-level writing. Let me start modifying each part step by step.

**Essay on Distance Learning with Errors**

In my opiniondistance learning is beneficial becauseit allows people to study from home while still working or taking care of family. One thing about distance learning is that you need good internet and devices to connect. Some schools use programs like Moodle or Canvas which have lessons assignments and places for questions.

I think it can be useful but I also see problems. Not everyone has good internet at home so they might miss classes. Also some lessons can be confusing if people don't understand them right away. Without face-to-face interaction learning may feel harder because students rely on messages or calls instead of talking in person. This can make it tough to focus during lessons.

I think distance learning is good for some but not everyone. If someone likes to study alone and doesn’t need face-to-face meetings it might work. But if they want to meet friends or teachers this type of learning may not be suitable.
