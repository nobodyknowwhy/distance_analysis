Okay, so I'm trying to help improve this essay about distance learning by making it look like it's written by an English learner who might be scoring a 3 out of 5. The user wants me to add more syntax errors and include first-person phrases like "In my opinion" or use practical examples. Also, the essay doesn't need to start with "Distance learning."

First, I'll read through the original essay to understand its content and structure.

The original essay talks about flexibility in timing, freedom in location, benefits like learning from friends globally, teachers using simple tools, challenges such as difficulty focusing without classmates, communication issues, and exam problems. It ends by saying distance learning is becoming more popular, especially after COVID-19.

Now, to make it look like a student's work with score 3, I need to:

1. Add more syntax errors: things like comma splices, run-on sentences, missing articles, incorrect tenses.
2. Use more first-person: phrases like "I think," "In my opinion," "This can be challenging."
3. Include practical examples or personal touches.
4. Maybe use some repetitive words or awkward phrasing.

Let me go paragraph by paragraph and see where I can add errors and student-like expressions.

First sentence: "Distance learning is a way of studying where you don't have to be in the same place as your teachers and classmates." That's good, but maybe change it slightly. Perhaps start with something else or use a first-person pronoun like "I think distance learning..."

Wait, the user said not to start with the prompt, so I can introduce myself if needed.

In the original essay, the introduction is fine, but since we're starting fresh, perhaps change it to a more personal statement. But maybe just adjust it without altering too much.

Moving on, each paragraph needs editing. Let me look for places where I can add first-person and errors.

For example, in the first paragraph about flexibility: "It's very flexible because you can study at any time as long as you have a computer..." Maybe change to something like "I think it's really cool because...".

In the second paragraph about freedom: "You can learn from friends around the world." Maybe add that this is awesome but also include an example or how it connects with someone.

Third paragraph, challenges: Instead of saying "It can be hard to focus," maybe say "This can be challenging because..." and then explain why without classmates.

Also, use more contractions like "don't" instead of "do not", "isn't" instead of "is not".

Let me try to outline the changes:

1. Start with a personal statement introducing the topic.
2. Modify each point with first-person expressions and add errors in grammar.
3. Include examples or explanations that show some understanding but lack depth.

Wait, perhaps I should also keep the main content correct but present it in a way that shows gaps in knowledge, which is typical for a 3/5 score.

I'll need to make sure each paragraph flows with errors and uses first-person enough times without sounding too forced.

Okay, let me start drafting an improved version.

Distance learning has changed the way I approach studying. I think it's really cool because you don't have to go somewhere else for classes; instead, you can do everything from home or online. This is great when you're busy or need to look after family members.

I find that studying remotely gives me a lot of freedom in where and when I learn. It’s awesome to connect with friends from around the world through video calls during lessons. Teachers often use simple tools like emails instead of complicated software, which makes communication easier for everyone involved.

Yet, this method can be challenging at times. Trying to focus without classmates is tough because there's no chat or discussions. If my internet isn’t good, connecting with others becomes a problem. Also, exams feel harder because we can't see each other and the teacher might not explain things clearly.

Even though I think distance learning has its issues, I believe it’s becoming more popular. After COVID, schools closed down, so many students tried this new way of learning. Despite some difficulties, I'm glad I give it a try because it offers flexibility. However, I know there are still problems to work on.
