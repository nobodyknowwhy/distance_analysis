Okay, so I need to help this user by modifying an essay about distance learning into what an English learner might write. The goal is to give it a score of 3 out of 5. That means the essay should have some errors but still be somewhat understandable.

First, I'll read through the original essay provided. It's clear and well-structured, which isn't bad for a student just starting with writing. But since we need to lower the quality to a 3, I'll introduce more grammar mistakes, simpler vocabulary, and maybe repetitive sentences.

The user wants me to add more words and varied vocabulary without using overly complex terms. Also, adding first-person phrases like "In my opinion" or practical examples would make it feel more student-like. Syntax errors are also important here; making the sentences a bit choppy could help lower the score.

I'll start by expanding some sections. For example, instead of just saying "Distance learning is a type of education...", I can add more details about how students use it daily, maybe mention specific platforms or tools they interact with. I'll introduce errors like missing articles or incorrect verb forms to make it look less polished.

Including personal opinions using phrases like "I think" or "In my opinion" will make the essay feel more casual and student-like. Adding examples such as online courses during COVID-19 can show practical use, which is good for clarity but also adds context.

I'll also make sure to connect some sentences incorrectly or repeat ideas to create repetition without making it too obvious. Maybe start with a topic sentence that's somewhat unclear. Overall, the tone should be friendly but not too complex.

Finally, I'll ensure the essay still has an introduction and conclusion but with more errors and varied language than the original. This way, it's clear that while the ideas are there, the execution isn't perfect, which is exactly what a 3 would look like.

Distance learning is something students can get education through ways other than regular schools using digital stuff. It has been going on for so long but now people like more of it because of how tech has improved. One of the first times distance learning was used was back in World War II when they sent school materials to soldiers far away.

Today, it is often called online school or e-learning. Because the internet and ways to talk have grown better, more people can get good school without leaving their houses. 

Distance learning helps students who can’t go to schools normally. It also lets kids from different places learn together. But not everyone has good tech or fast internet connections which can stop it from being fair for some.

All in all, distance learning is a great way for students to learn even if they don’t feel like going to school. It’s still changing with how new things come along but it has its challenges. Though it isn’t perfect, it has lots of good parts that make people think about using it. I think this kind of learning is cool because you can study anywhere and anytime. For me, I’ve heard some people talk about taking online courses during the pandemic which was a big help for them. But even though it’s helpful, not everyone can use it equally well since some don’t have good tech at home. So while distance learning isn’t perfect, it has its advantages that make it worth thinking about.
