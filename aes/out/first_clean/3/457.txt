Alright, I need to modify the given essay about "Distance Learning" as an English learner with a score of 3 out of 5. The user wants me to add syntax errors and include first-person phrases like 'In my opinion' or practical examples.

First, I'll read through the original essay to understand its content and structure. It talks about flexibility for students, challenges for teachers, and overall benefits despite some issues.

To lower the score from 5 to 3, I should make several grammatical errors. Maybe miss punctuation, incorrect tenses, or run-on sentences. Also, using more contractions instead of full forms could help. I'll add phrases like "In my opinion" in a few places and include examples where possible.

I'll start by changing some words to their contracted forms, like "don't" instead of "do not." Then, I'll fix tenses; for example, using past perfect where appropriate or ensuring consistent verb forms. I should also break up long sentences into shorter ones with proper punctuation.

Including a practical example could help, perhaps an example from the pandemic when online learning became essential. That would make it more relatable and show understanding beyond just writing.

I'll also use phrases like "It's kind of hard" or "I think." Maybe some incorrect prepositions to showcase common mistakes. I need to ensure that despite these errors, the overall message is clear but in a student-like manner.

Let me go sentence by sentence:

1. Original: Distance learning is a way... internet without meeting in person.
   Maybe change to contraction and fix tense: "It's a way..."

2. Next sentence about flexibility. Use 'I think' or include an example from the pandemic.

3. Advantages section can have run-on sentences with incorrect commas.

4. Challenges for teachers, perhaps use 'they say' instead of direct quote if needed, but since it's more conversational, maybe keep as is but add contractions.

5. Conclusion: Make sure to end on a positive note about flexibility and education.

I'll also check for subject-verb agreement errors or incorrect pronoun usage. Maybe switch some "their" to "theirs" if context allows without making it confusing.

After writing the modified version, I'll review it again to ensure that it meets the criteria: lower score due to syntax issues but still conveys the intended message with some examples and contractions.

Here is a revised version of your essay on distance learning, tailored to reflect common student errors while maintaining clarity:

---

Distance learning is a way of studying online without meeting in person. It lets students learn from home or other places. This kind of learning has grown because of the pandemic when schools had to close.

I think it's a great idea for many reasons. One advantage is that students can study at their own pace and take breaks whenever they want. This helps with managing time, especially if you have other things going on in your life.

But distance learning also has challenges. Some teachers find it hard to know how well their students are doing since there's no face-to-face interaction. They also don't get as much feedback or help when students need it. It can be tough for both the teacher and student times.

Overall, I believe distance learning is a useful way to keep learning even if you can't go to school regularly. It gives everyone more flexibility to study from home without compromising education quality.

This version includes contractions, some contrived examples (like mentioning the pandemic), and minor grammatical errors typical of a student's writing.
