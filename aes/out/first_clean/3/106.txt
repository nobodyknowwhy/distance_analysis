Okay, so I need to help modify the given essay about "Distance Learning" to make it look like it was written by an English learner at around level 3. The user provided three versions: VG (Very Good), LF (Lower Frequency), and EA (Elementary or Approach). Since the goal is to create a lower proficiency version, I'll focus on that.

First, let me recall what a student at this level might do. They probably have more grammatical errors, shorter sentences, repetitive phrases, and they might use simpler vocabulary. They also tend to make more first-person mistakes, like using "I" too much or mixing tenses incorrectly.

Looking at the original essay provided:

1. It starts with a clear introduction about how distance learning is convenient but has challenges.
2. Specific examples are given for challenges (no home facilities) and benefits (learning at own pace).
3. The conclusion summarizes the points, mentioning that it's helpful in the future.

Now, to modify this into an elementary learner's version:

I should:
- Add more syntax errors: missing punctuation, incorrect tenses, possibly run-on sentences.
- Use more first-person pronouns like "I" or "my."
- Make repetitive phrases about challenges and benefits.
- Simplify vocabulary; use shorter words and phrases.

Let me go sentence by sentence.

Original 1st paragraph:
"Distance learning is a new way of studying that many students are using today."

Modify this to have errors. Maybe start with "I've heard..." or make it more casual, like "It's a cool new way..."

Next, the challenge part: "Some students may not have the same opportunities at home as they do in school." Maybe change to "Not everyone has good stuff at home," and use incorrect tenses.

The benefit example: "Students can learn at their own pace" might become "They can go slow or fast."

I should also make more general statements, like repeating that it's helpful in the future multiple times without varying the sentence structure.

Putting it all together, I'll ensure each error is intentional to meet the lower proficiency level. Let me draft a few sentences:

"I've heard about distance learning and how it's kind of new. It let people study at home which sounds cool but can be tricky."

"Like not everyone has good stuff at home like good internet or quiet places. It might make studying hard.

Teachers also have problems online. They don't know how to explain things well maybe and students can't ask questions easily."

"But some kids learn better alone so they go slow on parts they find tough which is okay."

"Overall I think it'll be helpful for many in the future but everyone has different needs so teachers need to help."

I'll check each part: more repetition, simpler language, intentional errors. Also, ensure the flow makes sense even with mistakes.

Wait, let me count if each sentence adds new info or repeats. Repetition is okay here as it shows a lower-level approach.

Now, compiling all these thoughts into an essay structure that's coherent despite the errors.

**Distance Learning Essay (Elementary Level)**

I've heard about distance learning and how it's kind of new. It let people study at home which sounds cool but can be tricky. Like not everyone has good stuff at home like good internet or quiet places. It might make studying hard.

Teachers also have problems online. They don't know how to explain things well maybe and students can't ask questions easily. But some kids learn better alone so they go slow on parts they find tough which is okay.

Some people think it's helpful in the future but everyone has different needs so teachers need to help. I think distance learning will be useful for many even though there are challenges. It's a cool new way of studying with its unique problems and benefits.
