Okay, so I'm trying to help an English learner improve their essay on "Distance learning" by adding more syntax errors and using first-person phrases to make it look less polished but still clear. The current score is a 3 out of 5.

First, I'll read through the original essay to understand its content and structure. It talks about challenges like distractions at home and technical issues, then mentions benefits such as accessibility for distant students and time management for parents.

I need to add more syntax errors without making it too confusing. Maybe miss some articles, change word orders, or use incorrect phrases. Also, I should include more personal touches with "In my opinion," "This is something I realized," etc.

Let me start by looking at each paragraph:

1. The first paragraph: It's okay to make the sentence structure a bit off. Instead of saying it's important because technology has changed lives, maybe say it's becoming more and more important as technology keeps changing...

2. In the challenges section, "staying focused" could be phrased as "I found staying focused challenging." Maybe mention specific distractions like my phone or other toys without making it too wordy.

3. The part about forgetting assignments might be changed to something like "I think some people forget their assignments easily."

4. The technical issues can have a more run-on sentence, missing some commas or conjunctions.

5. Benefits: For distant students, maybe say "it's super helpful for students who live far away from schools." Make sure the positive aspects are clear but with minor syntax errors.

6. Parent help: Maybe use "have" instead of "is having" to create a mistake.

7. The conclusion should encourage using technology wisely without making it too perfect.

I also need to make sure each paragraph flows, maybe adding some informal transitions like "On the other hand," or "In addition."

Let me start modifying:

First paragraph: Change structure and add more personal feelings about technology's impact.

Second paragraph: Personalize with "I realized" and specific examples.

Third paragraph: More casual language in explaining benefits.

Fourth paragraph: Use present tense mistakes, maybe missing an article.

Overall, I should keep the essay coherent but with enough errors to reflect a student's rough writing.

Distance learning has become increasingly important today as technology continues to shape our lives. While it offers many advantages, especially for those far from schools or parents needing help with homework, it can also be challenging at home due to distractions like my phone and toys.

I found staying focused on my work particularly difficult because of all the distractions around me. Sometimes, a simple distraction like my phone can pull me away completely. Additionally, I think some people easily forget their assignments, which can lead to falling behind if they don't manage their time well.

Another issue is technical problems such as bad internet or broken computers, which can disrupt learning. On the other hand, distance learning has its benefits. For students living far from schools, it's super helpful because they can attend classes without traveling long distances. Itâ€™s also good for those with jobs far from home schools and gives parents more time to help their children with homework.

In conclusion, while I believe distance learning is a great way to keep learning even when not near a school, we need to use technology wisely to make the most of it.
