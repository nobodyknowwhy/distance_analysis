Okay, so I need to act as an English learner student who's supposed to modify an essay about "Distance learning" in a way that shows lots of syntax errors, fewer connectives, more first-person phrases like "In my opinion," and practical examples. The goal is to make it look less polished than a professional writer.

Let me start by reading the original essay again:

Original:
- Distance learning refers to education where students learn from home using computers or internet.
- It lets students attend classes remotely via emails or videos and participate in online discussions.
- Advantages: Flexibility, study at own pace; expands access for remote areas with bad internet.
- Challenges: Communication issues between students and teachers, internet problems disrupting lessons, harder to see student understanding without visual cues.
- History: Began 80s/90s using computer-mediated comm but evolved with tech like virtual classrooms with whiteboards and video calls.
- Conclusion: While offers flexibility and access, challenges in tech reliability and communication.

Now, the task is to make this look more like an English learner's essay. So I need to add lots of mistakes—like missing articles, incorrect pluralization, run-on sentences without proper punctuation. Also, use fewer connectives and more first-person statements.

I should avoid starting with "In my opinion," but maybe include it here or there. Let me think about how each part can be improved.

First sentence: "Distance learning refers to a method of education where students learn from home through computer or internet access, avoiding traditional classroom settings." Maybe I can change this to something like "Distance learning is when people study at home using computers and the internet instead of going to school."

But that's too simple. Wait, maybe start with a run-on sentence without connectives.

Let me try rewriting each part step by step.

1. Original: Distance learning refers to... (maybe replace 'refers' with just stating it.)
"In distance learning, students learn at home using computers and the internet instead of going to school."

2. Original second point: It allows students to attend remotely via emails or videos.
"I can attend class from home through email messages or watch lessons online."

Wait, but that's not a sentence error; perhaps I should make it more run-on without connectives.

Maybe combine sentences: "Students can attend class remotely by sending email messages and watching online lessons."

3. Original advantage: Flexibility to study at own pace.
"In my opinion, one advantage is that students can learn when they want without strict schedules."

4. Expand access for remote areas with bad internet.
"It also helps people in faraway places who don’t have good internet connections."

5. Challenges: Communication issues between students and teachers.
"Another problem is that it’s hard to talk face-to-face so communication isn’t as easy."

Internet issues disrupting lessons:
"When the internet doesn't work, lessons can be canceled suddenly."

Harder for teachers to assess understanding without visual cues:
"It might also be tough for teachers to see if students understand what they’re learning."

History: Began in 80s/90s using computer-mediated comm.
"In the past, distance learning started using computers and simple messages but has improved a lot now with better tech."

Evolved with virtual classrooms:
"It has gotten better with virtual classrooms that have whiteboards and video calls now."

Conclusion: Offers flexibility but challenges remain in tech and communication.

So combining everything without connectives and adding first-person phrases:

"In distance learning, students learn at home using computers and the internet instead of going to school. I can attend class from home through email messages and watch lessons online. One advantage is that students can learn when they want without strict schedules. It also helps people in faraway places who don’t have good internet connections.

Another problem is that it’s hard to talk face-to-face so communication isn’t as easy. When the internet doesn’t work, lessons can be canceled suddenly. It might also be tough for teachers to see if students understand what they’re learning without visual cues.

In the past, distance learning started using computers and simple messages but has improved a lot now with better tech. It has gotten better with virtual classrooms that have whiteboards and video calls now."

Hmm, maybe I'm missing some points. Let me check each part for syntax issues:

- Missing articles: "a method of education" → just say "distance learning is when people study at home..."
- Pluralization: "computers or internet access" → correct.
- Run-on sentences without connectives: Yes, combined sentences.

First-person phrases are added like "In my opinion," which I can include more. Also, using "I" in some parts.

Wait, the user said to add lots of first-person phrases but not necessarily starting with the prompt. So maybe integrate "In my opinion" or other phrases where appropriate.

Also, make sure there are fewer connectives. For example, instead of saying "Additionally," just continue the sentence flow without linking words.

Perhaps in the conclusion, emphasize flexibility and mention challenges as issues.

I think I have a good start, but need to ensure each point is covered with syntax errors and limited connectives.
