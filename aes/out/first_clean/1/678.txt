Okay, so I need to help an English learner modify their essay on "Distance Learning" according to specific criteria. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the user wants the essay to have more single words and fewer complex sentences. They also want lots of syntax errors, which might include incorrect word orders or missing articles. The essay should use first-person phrases like "In my opinion" more often. Additionally, adding practical examples could make it seem more student-like. I shouldn't start with the prompt itself.

Looking at the original essay provided by the LLM, I can see that it's already quite basic but still needs some tweaks to match the lower score of 1. I'll go through each paragraph and adjust them as needed.

The first sentence introduces distance learning, mentioning it's used when people can't attend school due to health or living far away. I can simplify this further by using more single words and perhaps adding a personal perspective with "In my opinion."

Next, the part about studying at home with books and videos needs to be made simpler. Maybe replace some words like " sent" instead of "sent," add a conjunction where it makes sense, or use an example.

The third paragraph talks about how distance learning is good but not for everyone because some find it hard without face-to-face interaction. Here, I can introduce another personal opinion and maybe mention the challenges in a more conversational way with incorrect articles or word order to create errors.

In the fourth paragraph, it mentions its history from letters and postcards to now using modern tech like phone calls and videos. I'll add an example here about how technology has made this easier but also introduce some uncertainty by saying "It's not always easy" instead of a simple statement, which adds a natural mistake.

The future section can be modified with more single words and perhaps incorrect conjunctions. Instead of talking about it being "helping," maybe say "help people learn." I'll add an example like traveling without needing textbooks to illustrate the point but introduce an error in the sentence structure or word choice.

Finally, wrapping up by emphasizing that everyone should understand this learning method, adding a personal reflection with another first-person phrase. Maybe mention how this makes learning accessible and flexible as a practical example but have some errors in the concluding sentences.

Throughout the process, I'll ensure each modification reduces complexity, adds single words, uses more conjunctions incorrectly, and includes examples where appropriate to make it look like a student's work. I'll also avoid starting with "Distance learning" exactly as per instructions.

Distance learning is a way people study without going to school every day. It’s called online learning because you do it through the internet. People use it when they can’t go to school, maybe because of health issues or living far away.

In my opinion, many students find it hard but also helpful. You can learn from home using books and videos your teachers send. You talk with your teacher or classmates online too. Some say it’s good for learning new things without missing class. But some people think it’s not always easy because they miss seeing the teacher or classmates.

Distance learning has been around forever, starting when people taught each other through letters and postcards. Now, we have more ways like phone calls, videos, and even books. It’s getting better as schools use more technology now. In the future, it might be even better because tech keeps improving. People can learn new things anywhere they want. But everyone needs to check what they find online is real before reading or watching.

In my opinion, distance learning helps many people every day but isn’t always easy for some. Everyone should try to understand this way of learning and think about how it works best for them.
