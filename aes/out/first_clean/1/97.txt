Okay, so I need to help an English learner modify their essay about "Distance learning" by adding lots of syntax errors and using fewer conjunctions. They also want to include more first-person phrases like 'In my opinion' or add practical examples.

First, let me look at the original essay they provided:

"Distance learning is now common for people to study at home. It has become more popular because schools were closed during COVID-19. This method of studying uses computers and the internet. I think it's good because you can learn from home, but sometimes it's hard to stay focused without seeing your teacher or classmates. Also, sometimes the internet doesn't work well, which can cause problems.

I believe distance learning is helpful for people who have jobs or families that make it difficult to attend school. However, it might be boring if you don't enjoy watching videos or doing online assignments alone. In the future, I hope more schools offer this kind of learning so students can balance their lives better."

Now, I need to go through each part and introduce errors.

Starting with the first sentence: "Distance learning is now common for people to study at home." Maybe change it to something like "I think distance learning has become very common these days..." That adds a personal touch and changes the structure.

Next part: "It has become more popular because schools were closed during COVID-19." I can make that into a statement with an opinion, like "Yeah, I agree. It seems like everyone's using it now because of COVID."

Moving on: "This method of studying uses computers and the internet." Maybe say something like "But sometimes you need special tools to access the lessons." That adds a problem.

Then, "I think it's good because you can learn from home..." I'll change that to "In my opinion, distance learning is nice because you can study at home." That uses first person and a conjunction 'because' which might be missing or replaced with a comma.

Next sentence: "but sometimes it's hard to stay focused without seeing your teacher or classmates." Maybe make it more informal, like "It's tough to stay focused alone. I mean, you miss out on the interaction."

Then, "Also, sometimes the internet doesn't work well..." Perhaps say, "And sometimes the connection isn't always good, which can be a problem."

In the second paragraph: "I believe distance learning is helpful for people who have jobs or families that make it difficult to attend school." Change that to something like "For some, especially those with busy schedules, it's really useful because they don't have time to go to school." That adds variation and more detail.

Next sentence: "However, it might be boring if you don't enjoy watching videos..." Make it more colloquial, maybe "But for others, it can get kind of monotonous. I mean, sitting there watching videos all day sounds tedious."

Finally: "In the future, I hope more schools offer this kind of learning so students can balance their lives better." Change to "Looking ahead, I wish more schools would start offering online classes because balancing work and study is really important now."

Now, adding some extra errors like missing conjunctions. For example, in the first sentence after changing it: "Yeah, I agree. It seems like everyone's using it now because of COVID." Maybe remove 'because' or use a different structure.

Also, check for subject-verb agreement and other minor grammatical issues to make it look more like an English learner's work.

In my opinion, distance learning is nice because you can study at home. However, it's tough to stay focused alone. I mean, you miss out on the interaction with your teacher and classmates. And sometimes the connection isn't always good, which can be a problem.

For some, especially those with busy schedules, it's really useful because they don't have time to go to school. But for others, it can get kind of monotonous. I mean, sitting there watching videos all day sounds tedious.
