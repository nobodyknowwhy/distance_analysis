Okay, so I need to modify the given essay about distance learning according to the requirements for an English learner with a score of 1 out of 5. The original essay is already pretty basic, but there's room for improvement by adding more syntax errors and reducing connective words. Also, including some first-person phrases like "In my opinion" would help make it seem more personal.

First, I'll read the original essay again to understand its structure and content. It talks about distance learning starting in the 20th century, being accessible now, advantages for remote learners, struggles with motivation and technical issues, and future growth as technology improves.

Now, I need to add lots of syntax errors. That means making mistakes in sentence structure, maybe using fragments or run-on sentences. For example, instead of writing "This method allows students..." it could be "It lets students...". Also, not using proper connectives like 'however' or 'because'; instead, just linking ideas with phrases like 'on the other hand' but misspelling them or using informal replacements.

I should include more first-person elements. Phrases like "In my opinion," or "I think" can be added to make it sound more like a student's perspective. Adding practical examples would help explain points, so instead of just saying "some students find it harder to stay motivated," maybe say "like when I tried to study alone at home, sometimes I felt bored."

Let me start modifying each paragraph:

1. Original: Distance learning is a way people learn from places they aren't.
   I can make it: When distance learning started in the 20th century...

Wait, no, that changes the structure. Maybe just rewrite with more errors.

Actually, maybe it's better to completely rewrite the essay but include all required elements without making it too clear.

Another approach is to take each sentence and add errors:

Original: Distance learning is a way people learn from places they aren't.
Change: Learning from home is easier now because of the internet. It started back in the 20th century...

Wait, that's too similar to the original structure but with added words.

But I need to make it look like someone who isn't very good at English might write it. So maybe sentences are run-on or have incorrect tenses.

I think I'll rewrite each section adding these elements.

When distance learning began in the 20th century, it was a new way for people to study without being in a traditional classroom. Now, thanks to better technology, more people can learn from home or other faraway places through online classes.

One benefit of distance learning is that students don't have to go to school every day. This lets them study even if they live too far away from the nearest school. It's also good for adults who have jobs and families to take care of, allowing them time to study while managing their work.

However, some people might find it hard to stay motivated on their own or without help from teachers. Also, sometimes things like internet problems can happen during classes.

Looking ahead, distance learning will probably become even more popular as technology keeps improving. More schools might use this method because it's flexible and easier than regular classroom lessons.

In my opinion, while distance learning has its challenges, I think it can be a great way for many people to learn. With better technology, it could help more students around the world access education.
