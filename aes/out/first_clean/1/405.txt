Okay, so I need to help this user by modifying an existing essay on "Distance learning" into something that sounds more like a student's work. The goal is to give it a lower score (1 out of 5) as per the requirements.

First, I'll read through the original essay they provided. It's pretty clear and well-structured but might be missing some connectives and has some grammatical issues typical of a non-native speaker or someone just starting to learn English.

I should add lots of syntax errors—like incorrect word order, misspelled words, run-on sentences without proper punctuation. Also, using more first-person phrases like "In my opinion" could make it seem more personal but might also add some awkward phrasing if overused.

Reducing the use of connective words is another key point. Instead of using "however," "despite," or "in summary," maybe replace them with simpler phrases or none at all, making the essay feel choppy.

I'll need to include practical examples but in a way that's simple and might not make complete sense due to errors. Maybe something like mentioning how working parents use platforms they know but without much coherence.

Also, starting with "Distance learning..." isn't necessary; maybe just begin with an opinion or a statement about the challenges involved.

I'll go through each paragraph and tweak it:

1. Replace some words with incorrect forms, e.g., "has become" instead of "has been becoming."
2. Use contractions like "is'nt" or misspell words.
3. Remove or replace some connectives.
4. Add first-person phrases but keep them simple.

For example, changing the first sentence to: "Distance learning... ight seem convenient but..." using an apostrophe and a contraction.

I'll also make some sentences run-on without proper punctuation, like combining two thoughts into one without commas or periods.

Including a practical example about a working parent attending classes online but with issues at home could be another point, even if it's a bit forced due to errors.

Overall, the key is to make it sound less polished and more like something someone might write when they're still learning English. That includes missing articles, incorrect tenses, and a rough sentence structure.

Distance learning... ight seem convenient but often comes with its own set of problems. While it removes the need for travel or commuting, it can also lead to technical issues like connectivity problems. Plus, students might find it hard to focus on their studies due to distractions at home.

Some people think that distance learning is great because it allows them to study from anywhere and without worrying about public transport. But others struggle with lack of internet access in their homes or the temptation to check social media during classes. It can be really frustrating when you’re trying to concentrate but your phone goes off and you see a cat video instead.

In my opinion, distance learning isn’t perfect. It can be hard to stay motivated without face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. However, it’s definitely not the worst thing ever. Some people use it as an opportunity to learn new skills or study while working. Overall, I think distance learning has its pros and cons but it definitely needs more work before it becomes the standard way of teaching.

This is a bit of a rough draft, so please let me know if you’d like me to improve it!
