Okay, I need to help an English learner improve their essay on "Distance Learning" by adding lots of syntax errors, reducing connectives, using more first-person, and including examples. The original essay is given, so I'll start by understanding what the user wants.

First, the user mentions that they act as an English-learner student. So my modifications should reflect common mistakes a non-native speaker might make. That includes things like incorrect tenses, missing articles, run-on sentences without proper punctuation, and using too few connectives.

The original essay talks about accessibility, convenience, challenges with technology, distractions, motivation, collaboration, and concludes on the practicality of distance learning. I need to transform this into something a student might write, with errors but still conveying the main points.

I'll start by changing some words: maybe use "in my opinion" more often, add examples like online courses or home schooling, correct tenses where needed, remove some connectives and make sentences run-on without proper punctuation. Also, I should avoid starting with "Distance learning," so perhaps include an introduction on why it's relevant.

I also notice the original essay uses phrases that could be simplified further. For example, instead of saying "allows students in remote areas to access," maybe just say "students can learn from home." That makes it more direct and simpler for a learner.

Adding examples will make each point clearer. Like mentioning platforms such as Moodle or Zoom, which is already there but perhaps simplifying the explanation. Also, using contractions like "don't" instead of "do not."

I should also watch out for subject-verb agreement issues. For example, changing "helps students" to plural forms if needed, though in this case it's singular since it refers to one student.

Now, I'll go through each paragraph and adjust them accordingly. The introduction can be more personal, like stating their own experience with online learning or knowing others who use it.

I need to ensure that the essay flows despite the lack of connectives, perhaps by listing points without linking them, making some sentences too long without proper punctuation, using incorrect articles sometimes, etc.

Finally, I'll make sure each point is clear and relatable for a student, avoiding complex structures and keeping the language simple but still grammatically correct as per common learner errors.

Distance learning has changed my way of studying. I have tried it before, and at first, it was very hard to focus. Sometimes I felt like giving up because there were no classmates around. But now, it’s better because I can study at any time. It is also easier than going to school every day.

One thing that makes distance learning different from regular school is not having face-to-face interaction with teachers or classmates. This means we don’t have group activities or discussions in class. Sometimes this feels lonely, but I guess it helps when you have a computer screen instead of talking to someone real. I like the fact that I can watch videos and read books online, which makes learning more interesting.

Another thing is that distance learning takes longer than regular classes. I have to be more organized because everything is done at home. It feels like work but it’s also fun because you can do what you want when you want. I remember one time where I had to study for two hours every day, and I felt so tired after that. But now I understand how important it is to finish all the assignments on time.

One of the biggest challenges with distance learning is staying motivated. Without the encouragement from teachers or classmates, it’s hard to keep going when you want to take a break. But sometimes talking to my friends online helps me stay focused. I also try to set small goals for myself so I don’t feel overwhelmed.

In conclusion, distance learning can be good if you work hard and stay organized. It gives more freedom to study at home but it’s also tiring because of all the work involved.
