Alright, so the user wants me to act as an English learner modifying a given essay about distance learning. They mentioned that the original essay got a 1 out of 5, which is pretty low. My task is to add lots of syntax errors and use fewer conjunctions while incorporating more first-person phrases like "in my opinion" or adding examples.

First, I need to understand what makes an essay look like it's from a student with lower proficiency. They often make grammatical mistakes, have run-on sentences, and might lack proper transitions. Using fewer conjunctions would mean relying on cohesives less, which can create longer, more complex sentences that are harder to follow.

I should start by identifying where the original essay has opportunities for errors. Maybe replace some words with incorrect forms or use wrong prepositions. For example, changing "has become" to "has been" or using "classrooms" instead of "classes."

Next, I'll need to make sure that the essay flows without too many connecting words. Instead of sentences that smoothly transition from one idea to another, they might be choppy. This could involve longer sentences and less variety in sentence structure.

Adding first-person phrases like "I think," "in my opinion," or "this" can make it seem more personal and student-like. Including some examples will help illustrate points without making the essay seem too abstract.

Now, looking at each paragraph:

1. The first sentence is correct but needs a mistake. Maybe change "has become" to "have been." Also, instead of saying "gives people," say something incorrect like "gives freedom."

2. The second paragraph talks about the challenge of internet access and lack of computers. I can make it sound more casual with phrases like "like not having a computer at home" or using contractions.

3. Another point is motivation without in-person interaction. Maybe use a mistake like saying "some people don’t have motivation" instead of "find it hard."

4. The conclusion mentions that schools should consider distance learning, but I can make this part incorrect with phrases like "many students" instead of "most."

I also need to ensure the essay has fewer conjunctions. So, where there would normally be words like "and," "but," or "or," I might omit them and use semicolons or even no separators at all.

Including examples will make each point clearer but can also help avoid mistakes if not done carefully. Maybe talk about personal experiences or hypothetical situations without making them too complex.

Finally, I'll check the essay to ensure it's cohesive despite the errors, perhaps using phrases like "in my opinion" multiple times and varying sentence structures for readability.

Putting it all together, each section will have its own set of mistakes, fewer conjunctions, more first-person usage, and examples where possible. The goal is to create an essay that feels unpolished but still conveys the intended message.

Distance learning has become a popular way to study today. It allows people to learn from home without going to school. I think this is a good thing because it gives freedom and flexibility.

One of the challenges with distance learning is not everyone can get internet at home. Some don’t have computers or reliable internet connections so they can’t participate in online classes. Also teachers can’t give individual help which makes it hard for students far away from each other.

Another challenge is some people find it hard to stay motivated without being in a classroom. They miss asking questions face-to-face and working with classmates. But I think distance learning is good because it helps you learn while doing other things like work or caring for family.

It’s also convenient for people living far from schools. It saves time and money compared to in-person classes. However not all students benefit equally some may find it harder to focus without the same interaction as traditional classes.

In conclusion distance learning has pros and cons. Some struggle with technical issues or lack resources while others find it flexible. I think more schools should try this because it works for different situations.
