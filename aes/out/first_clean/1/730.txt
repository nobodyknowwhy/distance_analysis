Alright, I need to help this user by modifying their essay about distance learning to make it look like it's written by an English learner. The goal is to give it a score of 1 out of 5 based on the specified criteria: lots of syntax errors, fewer conjunctions, more first-person phrases, and some added examples.

First, I'll read through the original essay to understand its structure and main points. It talks about distance learning's benefits like flexibility and access to advanced topics, as well as challenges such as student motivation and technical issues.

Since the user wants lots of syntax errors, I'll replace words with their singular forms where possible, use repetitive phrases, and maybe misuse prepositions. For example, instead of saying "students do not meet," I could say "students don't meet."

I should also reduce the number of conjunctions like 'and,' 'but,' and 'for.' Instead, I might use more repetition or omit some words entirely to create a run-on sentence effect.

Including first-person phrases like "In my opinion" will help make it sound more personal. Adding examples, such as how distance learning allows people with disabilities to continue education, can enrich the essay.

I'll start by changing sentences without using conjunctions and add repetitive elements where possible. I'll also simplify vocabulary and avoid complex sentence structures typical in a high school level.

Now, let me go through each paragraph of the original essay and make these adjustments.

Distance learning is a way of education where students don’t meet face-to-face but instead study online over the internet. More people are choosing this because of health problems during the pandemic. Many schools have moved to online teaching due to safety concerns or other issues.

One benefit I think distance learning has is it gives students more freedom, like studying at their own pace and when they want. This can help if someone works or takes care of family while school. It also provides access to courses not available in normal schools, such as advanced topics or special subjects people couldn’t take before.

But I feel there are some problems with distance learning too. For example, students might miss out on face-to-face interactions with teachers and classmates like in regular classes. Some might struggle if they don’t have good internet at home to watch videos properly. Also, it can be hard for students who need help because they can’t ask questions in real time.

In conclusion, distance learning has its pros but also some issues. With more work and better support, it could be as effective as traditional schools.
