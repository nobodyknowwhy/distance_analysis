Okay, I need to help a student who's learning English modify an essay about distance learning so that it reflects how a novice might write it. The goal is to get it down to a score of 1 out of 5. 

First, I'll read the original essay provided by the large language model. It has some grammar errors and uses proper conjunctions effectively. My task is to make more mistakes and use fewer connectives.

I should start by adding lots of first-person phrases like "In my opinion" or "I think." Maybe also include personal opinions, even if they're not entirely accurate. That could make it seem more like a student's draft.

I need to replace some proper conjunctions with coordinating adverbs or just avoid them altogether. For example, instead of saying "However," I might just say "On the other hand" without using the conjunction. Also, including some run-on sentences would help because they show an understanding that writing is still developing.

Adding practical examples can make it more engaging and show a bit of thought, even if those thoughts are flawed or not entirely relevant. Maybe mention how staying at home helps with time management despite having kids or something like that.

I should also introduce some technical inaccuracies in grammar. For example, instead of using "using," maybe say "with" or miss a word. Also, varying the sentence structure will make it look less polished.

Lastly, I need to avoid starting with the essay prompt and keep the introduction short without proper topic sentences. Ending abruptly might leave the reader confused.

Putting all these together, I'll rewrite each paragraph step by step, making sure each change aligns with the requirements for a score of 1.

In my opinion distance learning is a way to study from home using computers or tablets. It’s often used when schools are closed because of health issues like during the COVID-19 pandemic. This method allows students to learn at their own pace and in comfortable settings without needing to go to school regularly.

One benefit is that it offers flexibility which helps with managing time for other activities like work or family responsibilities. Students can attend classes whenever they want making it easier to balance study with personal life.

However there are challenges too. Without seeing teachers face-to-face some students might find it harder to stay focused and ask questions. Also technical issues while using online tools can be frustrating and sometimes lead to cheating during exams if answers aren’t monitored closely.

In the end distance learning has its pros and cons. While it’s flexible it also requires strong self-discipline to stay on track with studies. As technology keeps improving more students are choosing this method which is likely to become even more popular in the future.
