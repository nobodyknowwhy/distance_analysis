Okay, I need to help this user by modifying an essay about distance learning according to specific instructions for an English learner score of 1 out of 5. The original essay provided talks about the pros and cons of distance learning during the pandemic.

First, I should understand what aspects make a student's writing look like a non-native speaker. They might use a lot of informal language, lack proper sentence structure, have multiple errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling. Also, they often use conjunctions less than an average writer would.

The essay needs lots of syntax errors. Maybe using run-on sentences or incorrect tenses. I should also add some first-person phrases like "In my opinion" to make it more personal but perhaps a bit repetitive.

I need to include fewer conjunctions, so transitions between ideas might be weak or omitted. Using examples could help clarify points, which is good for learning but sometimes students might overdo it without context.

The essay doesn't have to start with the prompt "Distance learning," so I can begin with something else about personal experience or another angle related to the topic.

Let me go through each paragraph and make necessary changes. The first paragraph mentions how schools started teaching online due to the pandemic, but I can make it more informal by changing words like "many schools" to "some schools." Maybe using contractions where appropriate.

The second paragraph talks about studying at any time with videos and books. I can introduce a personal experience or emotion here to add an example, but be careful not to overdo it. Also, correcting grammatical errors like "bell" instead of "bells."

Third paragraph compares the positive aspects (flexibility) with the negatives (boredom). Maybe change "Some people think..." to a more informal structure and introduce an opinion or example.

The future part can be made more conversational by talking about personal plans, even if it's not realistic. Also, adding a bit of uncertainty using words like "maybe" instead of "could."

I should also add some first-person phrases naturally without making them look forced. Maybe say something like, "In my opinion, distance learning has its pros and cons."

Now, I'll go through each part step by step to make sure I incorporate these changes effectively, ensuring the essay reflects a lower proficiency level with English errors and fewer complex sentence structures.

Distance learning is an interesting way people can study. It's different from going to school every day because of the pandemic. Some schools started teaching online so students could go home or other places to learn.

One thing that’s good about distance learning is you can study anytime, like when you have free time. You don’t have to wait for a bell to ring, and you can watch videos or read books on your computer or phone easily. But sometimes it’s hard because of bad internet or bad weather outside.

Some people think distance learning isn’t so bad because they can do homework at home without talking to teachers or friends. But I find it boring when you don’t feel like studying. It feels kind of lonely.

In the future, maybe schools will use better tools so students can learn more and have fun while doing it. But right now, everyone has to work hard even if distance learning isn’t perfect for everyone.
