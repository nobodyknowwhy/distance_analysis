Alright, I need to help this user modify an essay about distance learning into what an English learner might write. The score should be around 1 out of 5.

First, the original essay has some good points but lacks many details and examples. As a language learner, they might struggle with complex sentences and use repetitive words or incorrect conjunctions. I'll add lots of errors to make it look more student-like.

I'll start by replacing some phrases with simpler ones. Instead of "gives people more freedom," maybe "let you study from home." Also, instead of listing points clearly, they might connect them without proper transitions, so I'll use some conjunctions but perhaps not too many since the user mentioned using fewer.

Adding first-person phrases like "In my opinion" or "I think" can make it seem more personal. I should include practical examples to enrich the essay. Maybe mention working parents or students with health issues as examples of who benefits from distance learning.

The structure might be a bit disorganized for a learner, maybe starting with some errors in grammar and punctuation. Words like "because" used multiple times without variation could help show repetition.

I'll also add incorrect articles or prepositions, like saying "a good internet" instead of "the best." Including run-on sentences without proper conjunctions will make it look less polished.

Finally, I'll ensure the essay flows a bit but with some choppy parts and maybe incomplete ideas. Ending abruptly might help in making it seem less polished.

Distance learning is a way people study at home online or on TV instead of going to school regularly. It lets you learn from home while doing other stuff like work or taking care of family.

This kind of learning is important because it gives people more freedom and flexibility. It helps students who have jobs or families to go to class without missing work.

But distance learning can sometimes be hard for students since they don’t talk much with teachers and others face-to-face. This may make them feel less helped compared to regular schools.

Also, not everyone has the same access to good internet or technology at home, which could stop them from learning online well.

Even though there are challenges, distance learning is still a way for people to get education when they can’t go to school in person.
