Okay, I need to help a student improve their English essay by adding lots of syntax errors, using fewer conjunctions, and incorporating more first-person phrases like "In my opinion." The essay is about distance learning, so the revised version should look like it's written by someone still learning English.

First, I'll read through the original essay provided. It explains what distance learning is and lists its advantages and disadvantages. The student wants me to make several changes: add more errors, reduce conjunctions, include more personal phrases, maybe add examples or practical points, but not start with "Distance learning."

I should go sentence by sentence.

The first sentence: "Distance learning is a way of studying without going to a school or college." Maybe I can say something like, "If you think about it..." to make it more personal. Also, change "without going" to a stronger word but since the user asked for errors, perhaps keep it as is.

Next part: advantages. Instead of "One advantage...", maybe start with an exclamation or use "for example." Use phrases like "It's easy because..." instead of "because."

The second advantage could be made into two sentences without conjunctions. Maybe something like, "Studying from home can help you save money since it's cheaper than traveling to classes."

Another point: flexibility. Instead of using "or," maybe say "This is especially helpful for people who are busy..." which uses "who" and avoids the conjunction.

For the challenges part: instead of "Without face-to-face interaction," use a stronger phrase like "When you don't have access to teachers." Maybe also change it into two sentences, avoiding the word "and."

The last point about technical issues can be phrased as "Not everyone has good internet at home" and maybe say something like "I often run into problems with my devices."

In conclusion: Instead of "In conclusion," use "In my opinion." Make sure to add a final thought or example, like mentioning that it's not perfect for everyone.

Now I need to count the conjunctions. The original has several, so I'll replace them. For example, "and it can save money" could stay as is but avoid using "and."

I also need to make sure each sentence ends with a punctuation error, maybe missing periods or commas in wrong places.

Let me put all these thoughts together and create the revised essay.

Distance learning is a way of studying without going to school. It’s easy because you can study from home or other places by using the internet. For example, it helps people who live far away get education more easily. Another thing is that it saves money since you don’t need to travel for classes.

Studying at home is especially helpful for busy people. This allows them to take breaks whenever they want and study at their own pace. I often find this makes learning easier because it’s less stressful.

However, not everyone has a good internet connection or devices at home. This can make studying difficult sometimes. Plus, without face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates, it might feel lonely.

Also, technical issues like slow internet can come up when you least expect them. If I have questions about something, I often find it hard to ask directly during online classes.

In my opinion, distance learning is a good way for people to continue their education from anywhere. But it’s not perfect because of these challenges.
