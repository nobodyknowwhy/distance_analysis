Okay, I need to help this user by modifying an essay about distance learning into what an English learner would write. The goal is to get a score of 1 out of 5, which means making lots of errors and using first-person a lot.

First, I'll read the original essay they provided. It's pretty clear but lacks many mistakes. I need to add more syntax errors—like run-on sentences, missing commas, wrong tenses. Also, include phrases like "In my opinion" or examples to make it sound student-like.

I should start by changing some of the main points into smaller ones with personal opinions. For example, instead of saying distance learning is a method without classrooms, maybe say I think distance learning is when people learn from home because schools closed during COVID.

Then, point out that students can't interact face-to-face, which causes distractions or lack of motivation. Maybe mention forgetting passwords as a common issue and how they have to restart assignments multiple times.

Next, talk about the lack of encouragement making some students drop out early—using examples like homework becoming more important than schoolwork.

But also highlight how it's useful for those without nearby schools or who are busy or sick, even though sometimes it's not fun. Maybe include a personal experience where they had to teach themselves math using videos and online resources.

Finally, suggest that technology will change education in the future because of all the tools available now—maybe mention AI grading systems or virtual classrooms making lessons more interactive.

Throughout this process, I'll sprinkle in first-person phrases like "I think," "In my opinion," "For example," and maybe add a personal anecdote about struggling with passwords or feeling isolated. Also, include errors like missing commas between ideas, run-on sentences without proper conjunctions, and incorrect verb forms to make it look less polished.

Make sure the essay flows a bit but isn't too coherent because of these mistakes. Keep each point short and separate, showing that the writer might be struggling with understanding how to structure essays properly.

I'll also avoid starting with "Distance learning is..." since the user doesn't have to start like that. Instead, maybe open with an opinion or personal thought about how education has changed during the pandemic.

Overall, I need to make sure each sentence is a bit choppy, uses informal language, and includes plenty of errors so it looks like someone was rushing to write it without proofreading.

Distance learning has been a big topic lately. Honestly, I think it’s this new way people are supposed to learn stuff from home because schools closed during the pandemic. But honestly, it’s not always easy. One thing that comes to mind is how students can’t see their teachers and classmates face-to-face. Instead, they have to use computers or phones to watch videos online. Honestly, I’ve had trouble focusing on my studies when doing this because everything feels a bit distracting.

Another thing that’s been tough for me personally is dealing with internet connections. Sometimes, it just doesn’t work well, and I end up restarting assignments over and over again. Honestly, it can be frustrating trying to stay motivated without someone around to help keep me on track during class time. For example, last week, when I tried to study for a big test, I ended up doing chores instead because nothing seemed productive.

But even though these challenges exist, I think distance learning has its benefits too. For one, it helps students learn better in places where they don’t have a nearby school. Honestly, that’s been really helpful for me since my town is pretty far from any schools. It also lets people who are super busy or have health issues keep studying even when they wouldn’t be able to go to class.

Looking at the future, I’m not sure how distance learning will change education. But honestly, it might just make things even better because of all the online tools that exist now. For example, maybe in the next few years, everyone will have access to AI systems that can grade papers automatically or virtual classrooms where students can interact more like they used to in person.

Overall, distance learning has definitely changed how I think about education and how I approach studying on my own. Honestly, it’s a lot of work sometimes, but at least it gives people more flexibility and options when trying to learn something new.
