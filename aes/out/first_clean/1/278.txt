Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an English learner. They want me to modify a given essay about "Distance learning" by adding lots of syntax errors and using fewer conjunctions. Plus, they mentioned including more first-person phrases like 'In my opinion' or adding practical examples. The original score for the essay was 1 out of 5 because it's not very good.

First, I need to understand what each part means. Syntax errors would include things like incorrect word order, missing articles, wrong tenses, etc. Using fewer conjunctions might mean relying more on 'and' and less on words like 'but', 'because', or 'so'. First-person phrases can make the essay seem more personal, which is good for a student's writing.

Looking at the original essay:

- It starts with "Distance learning..." which is fine.
- The first paragraph talks about not needing to go to school every day, watching lessons online, homework from home. Maybe I can add some errors here, like missing articles or incorrect forms.
- Next part mentions it helps people with jobs or families and uses videos and tests. Maybe change "use" to something else or add an error in tense.

In the second paragraph, talking about kids having time for play or helping parents, using fun but hard sometimes without a nearby teacher. Here, I can introduce some errors like 'they' instead of 'it', incorrect past tense, etc.

Third paragraph: helps people while working or traveling, easier for students in other countries to study together. Maybe change "makes it easier" to an incorrect form or omit some words.

Finally, the overall statement and conclusion should be adjusted with more personal touches like "In my opinion".

I need to make sure that each sentence has errors and that conjunctions are minimized. Also, include phrases like 'In my view', 'In my opinion' where appropriate.

Let me try rewriting it step by step:

Original paragraph 1: Distance learning is a way of studying without going to school every day.
- Maybe change "without" to "but not" or something else? Hmm, no, "without" is correct here. But perhaps add an error in the next sentence. Like instead of saying "you can watch lessons online and do homework from home", maybe say "watching lessons online and doing homework from home". Wait, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe split it into two sentences with a wrong conjunction.

Wait, no, I need to add syntax errors. So perhaps make the sentence: "Itâ€™s helpful for people who have jobs or families. It also helps students learn even when they are sick."

But in the original, it was: "This is helpful for people who have jobs or families. It also helps students learn even when they are sick." Maybe change 'is' to 'be' and add an error elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just go through each sentence and fix a few errors:

1. Distance learning is a way of studying without going to school every day.
   - Fix: Maybe say "It's not necessary to attend school every day." That adds an error but changes meaning slightly.

2. Instead, you can watch lessons online and do homework from home.
   - Fix: Change 'can' to 'be able to' or add a mistake like 'do your homework from home'.

3. This is helpful for people who have jobs or families. It also helps students learn even when they are sick.
   - Maybe say "It's useful for individuals with busy schedules and beneficial for students who are unwell."

Wait, but I'm supposed to use fewer conjunctions, so maybe connect sentences without 'and' or 'but'.

4. Some schools use videos and online tests instead of classes.
   - Change that to: "Some schools offer video lessons and online testing instead of traditional classroom teaching."

Then the second paragraph:

5. In my view, distance learning gives kids more time to play outside or help their parents.
   - Maybe say "In my opinion, it allows children extra time to play or assist their parents."

6. Some schools use videos and online tests instead of classes.
   - Change 'instead' to a different structure.

Third paragraph:

7. It helps people learn while working or traveling.
   - Maybe change to: "It's beneficial for individuals who are engaged in professional fields or on international trips."

8. It also makes it easier for students in other countries to study together.
   - Perhaps say: "This is especially helpful for students from different nations to collaborate and exchange knowledge."

9. Overall, distance learning is great for learning new things without missing important moments in life.
   - Maybe rephrase as: "In my opinion, distance learning proves to be a valuable method that allows learners to acquire new skills without compromising on essential life experiences."

Wait, but I need to add first-person phrases more.

Let me try putting it all together with these changes and see if it makes sense. Also, ensure fewer conjunctions are used, maybe even omit some.
