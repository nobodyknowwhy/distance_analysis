Okay, so I need to modify the given essay about "Distance Learning" to reflect how it would be written by an English learner at Level 1. The user wants lots of syntax errors, more first-person phrases like "In my opinion," and some practical examples to make it seem less polished.

First, I'll start by identifying where I can add common mistakes that a Level 1 student might make. For example, using incorrect past tense ("attended" instead of "went") or misuse of articles (using "a" when "the" is more appropriate). Also, repetitive phrases and simple sentence structures would help.

Next, adding first-person phrases like "In my opinion," "I think," or "This makes me feel" can make the essay look more personal. Including some examples will add depth without being too complex.

I'll also ensure that the essay has an introduction, body paragraphs with examples, and a conclusion, but each section might have errors to mimic a less advanced writer's mistakes.

Let me outline the structure: start with an introduction stating what distance learning is, then talk about challenges and how it helps some people, ending with a conclusion. Each part will include errors and first-person statements.

I need to make sure that despite these mistakes, the essay still covers all necessary points about distance learningâ€”like technology issues, flexibility for study time, and its pros and cons.

Let me also think about common Level 1 errors: subject-verb agreement mistakes, incorrect article usage, repetitive phrases instead of synonyms, and simple punctuation errors. Incorporating these will help in making the essay look more like it's been written by someone still learning English.

Finally, I'll write each section with these considerations in mind, ensuring that the overall flow is logical but not too convoluted due to the errors.

**Distance Learning: My Experience and Thoughts**

Distance learning has become a new way for me to study. It allows students to learn from home using the internet or TV. But I think it can be challenging at times. For instance, sometimes my computer doesn't work well, making it hard to watch lessons properly. Also, I miss the chance to talk face-to-face with my teachers and classmates.

On the other hand, distance learning is helpful because it gives me more time to study without worrying about going to school. It's also flexible, so I can learn when I want to. But sometimes this flexibility makes it hard to stay focused, especially during long days of studying from home.

In my opinion, distance learning is a good way to continue education even when schools are not in session. However, I think students should be careful with their technology and try to focus as much as possible. Overall, while there are some challenges, I believe distance learning can work well for many people who want to learn but can't go to school.
