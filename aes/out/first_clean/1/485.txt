Okay, so I need to modify this essay about distance learning as if it's been written by an English learner who's just starting out. The goal is to make the score lower, probably around 1 out of 5 because they're still a beginner. 

First, I should add lots of syntax errors. That means incorrect grammar, maybe run-on sentences, and wrong word usage. Also, reducing the use of connective words like "however" or "in addition" would help. Instead, using more informal transitions or no transitions at all might make it look less polished.

The essay needs to have a lot of first-person phrases like "I think," "In my opinion," or "My experience shows." Adding practical examples could also help because they make the content more relatable and show a better understanding. For instance, mentioning how distance learning helped during the pandemic with remote work availability.

Starting sentences should be shorter and simpler. Maybe using conjunctions in ways that don't make complete sense to keep it raw. Also, avoiding complex sentence structures altogether would lower the score.

I'll need to make sure each paragraph is short and not too detailed. Adding errors like missing commas or incorrect tenses can trip things up. Maybe misspell some words to show a lack of proofreading.

Overall, I should prioritize simplicity in language, informal phrasing, and lots of mistakes to make it look less educated.

Distance learning is an educational approach where students learn without going to school in person. It lets people from different places study remotely often through the internet.

One advantage of distance learning is that it gives some students more flexibility. During the COVID-19 pandemic many schools and colleges switched to online classes because they were closed. This method can also help those who can't attend regular education due to health reasons or other personal issues.

Technology plays a big role in distance learning. Tools like Zoom make it possible for teachers and students to have live lessons together. Also, recorded lectures allow those who missed a class to watch them later.

However some students might find it hard to stay focused at home without supervision and teachers may struggle with interacting with many students remotely. Not all schools have the necessary equipment for online learning which can be a problem for some students.

In conclusion distance learning is a useful alternative education method but still needs more development. It has its pros and cons making it important to consider carefully before choosing this option.
