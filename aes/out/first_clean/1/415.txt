Okay, so I need to help an English learner improve their essay on "Distance Learning." They provided an original version and a revised version with more errors and first-person usage. The user wants me to act as someone who's learning English and modify the given article according to specific requirements.

First, I should understand what they're asking for. They want to make the essay look like it's written by an English learner at a lower proficiency level. That means adding lots of syntax errors—things like run-on sentences, incorrect tenses, and passive voice over active voice where appropriate. Also, using fewer conjunctions will help keep the writing fragmented, which is common in rough drafts.

They mentioned including more first-person phrases, like "In my opinion" or "I think," to make it seem student-like. Adding practical examples could also help, but I need to ensure they're relevant and not too complex since this might lower the overall score towards 1 out of 5.

Looking at their original essay, it's well-structured with clear points and transitions. The revised version has multiple run-on sentences, some incorrect tenses, and passive voice used improperly. It also uses "I think" a few times, which is good for first-person usage but could be overused if done incorrectly.

I should go through each paragraph and add errors systematically. For example, break up long sentences into shorter ones with periods instead of semicolons or commas. Change some active voice constructions to passive where it makes the sentence clearer despite the error. Also, replace some conjunctions like "and" or "but" with less appropriate connectors to make the essay look more informal.

I'll also include more first-person statements without making them flow well. Maybe start sentences with phrases like "In my opinion," "Like most people," or "Overall." Adding examples related to distance learning, such as relying on online resources or balancing work and family responsibilities, can make the essay seem more real and relatable.

I need to avoid starting the essay with "Distance learning refers..." since they don't have to do that. Instead, I'll start with a topic sentence about how distance learning has become more common now. Then, each body paragraph will address a point but be choppy and error-prone.

Let me check for any grammar issues as well—using incorrect verbs tense or subject-verb agreement errors. For example, changing "requires" to "require" where appropriate without making the sentence too awkward.

Finally, I'll make sure that the conclusion is similarly rough, using phrases like "Overall," but without a strong closing statement, which might reflect a less confident learner's approach.

I need to ensure that all these changes don't detract from understanding the main points but make it clear that there are multiple writing issues typical of an English learner. This will help in improving their skills over time.

Distance learning has become more common now than ever before. It is a way for people to study without going to school or university on-site. Many people find this method helpful because they can study at home through the internet.

One advantage of distance learning is that it gives students a lot of flexibility. They can choose when and where to study, which helps them balance their education with other things like work or family responsibilities. But sometimes, doing homework without talking to teachers face-to-face makes it hard for students to ask questions or get help when they need it.

Another thing about distance learning is that students have to rely on online tools and resources. These can be good if the information is there, but sometimes they might not work well or be clear enough. Because of this, some people prefer in-person classes where teachers can explain things more easily.

Overall, even though distance learning has its challenges, I think it can help students learn better because they can study at a time that works best for them. But if you don't have access to good internet or technology, it might not work well for everyone.

In conclusion, while distance learning is different from traditional classes, it’s helpful in many ways. It gives people the freedom to study on their own schedule and helps with balancing other things in life like work or family responsibilities. But students still need to stay focused without having face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates, which can be hard at times.
