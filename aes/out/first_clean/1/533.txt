Alright, I'm trying to help an English learner improve their essay on "Distance Learning." The goal is to make it look like someone just starting out by adding lots of syntax errors and reducing connectives while using more first-person examples.

First, I'll read the original essay carefully. It talks about how distance learning has evolved education, its benefits like flexibility for remote areas, managing schedules, and challenges like unequal access, technical issues, and isolation.

I need to make it simpler with mistakes—like subject-verb agreement errors, incorrect articles, and run-on sentences. Also, use more "In my opinion" or "I think" instead of complex connectives. Maybe start with a personal experience or example related to distance learning.

Let me break down each paragraph:

1. **Introduction**: The original starts by stating it's an evolution in education. I can make it more informal and add a personal touch, like maybe talking about using online classes during COVID-15.

2. **Flexibility for remote areas**: In the original, they say access to classrooms is tough. Maybe instead of "physical classrooms," use something less precise or correct but less formal.

3. **Managing schedules**: The original talks about balancing work and family with studies. I can simplify this, perhaps using examples like juggling online school with work commitments.

4. **Widespread adoption during pandemic**: Mentioning institutions shifting suddenly to online platforms—maybe make a mistake here, like saying "suddenly moved" instead of "shifted."

5. **Opportunities and challenges**: The original says some find self-paced helpful, others face tech issues or focus problems. I can express these as personal experiences.

6. **Challenges: unequal access to internet**: Maybe say "not everyone has reliable internet," which is a mistake but clear.

7. **Student isolation**: Instead of "miss out on face-to-face interactions," perhaps "miss out on talking with friends."

8. **Technical issues**: Replace "incompatible devices" with something like "broken devices" or "slow internet."

9. **Conclusion**: Summarize how distance learning gives flexibility but has challenges like tech problems and isolation.

I should also avoid using a lot of connective words, so instead of "However," maybe use a transition that's less formal, like "On the other hand."

Let me try to outline:

- Start with personal experience or simple statement.
- Make sentences run on without proper commas or conjunctions.
- Use first-person phrases more often.
- Simplify complex sentences.

I need to ensure each sentence is clear but not necessarily correct. Maybe include some repetitive phrases for emphasis, like "I think" multiple times.

Let me try writing a draft based on this plan, adding the required mistakes and using simpler language.

Distance learning has changed how I study. It's really flexible now! I used to have trouble when I was in school because of my bad back. But with online classes, I can sit at my computer and learn without any pain.

It helps me be more organized too. For example, I balance working after school and studying. It’s like having a schedule that works for both.

During the pandemic, many schools switched to online learning suddenly. I think some people didn’t know what to do at first but now it feels normal. But not everyone has the same luck with technology or places to study.

Some days are really tough because of bad weather. It’s hard to focus when outside is cold. Plus, sometimes my computer breaks down and I can't finish my work.

I think about how important internet access is for learning at home. If someone doesn’t have good internet, they might miss out on helpful videos or online tools.

In the end, distance learning works well but needs more help from schools to make sure everyone has what they need. It’s a great way to study but can be hard sometimes because of tech issues and bad weather.

I think I'll try to use my phone for studying instead next time. Maybe that will help me stay connected with friends during breaks too!
