Okay, I need to write an essay about distance learning. But since my English is at level 1, I have to be careful not to use too many complex words or structure the sentences in a complicated way. Let me start by thinking about what distance learning is.

So, distance learning means people learn without going to a traditional classroom. Maybe it's done online or through other materials sent by the school. I remember sometimes watching videos and doing assignments at home. I should mention how it has changed over time because initially, maybe not many people used it, but now more schools are using it.

I think there are some benefits too, like you can learn at your own pace, which is good if you have other stuff to do. Also, it might be cheaper than regular school. But I should also talk about the challenges. Like, sometimes it's harder to stay focused without face-to-face interaction. Also, technical issues could come up when trying to access online materials.

Hmm, how long should this essay be? Maybe around 10 sentences or so, keeping each sentence simple and clear. Let me outline the points:

1. Definition of distance learning.
2. How it works (online or materials sent).
3. Growth in popularity over time.
4. Benefits: flexibility, cheaper, self-paced.
5. Challenges: focus harder, technical issues.

I need to make sure my sentences aren't too long and avoid using complex vocabulary. Maybe use words like "helpful" instead of "beneficial." I should also check that each idea is clear without being repetitive.

Wait, maybe I can mention how technology has made distance learning easier now, but in the past, it was harder because people didn't have as much access to computers or the internet. That could show some challenges too.

I think that's a good start. Now, let me try putting it all together in simple English.

Distance learning is a way of studying without going to school every day. It can be done online, through videos and assignments sent by teachers. Over time, more schools are using this method because it offers flexibility.

One benefit is that you can study at your own pace, which helps if you have other activities. It's also cheaper than regular school. However, some challenges exist, like staying focused without seeing the teacher or classmates in person. Sometimes, technical problems might happen when accessing learning materials.

Distance learning has grown more popular over time because technology makes it easier now. Without proper access to computers and the internet before, it was harder for many people to use this method effectively.
