Alright, so I have this task where I need to act as a student at English level 1 and write an essay about distance learning. The user provided specific criteria for each grade level, from VG down to EA. My goal is to write an essay that fits within the EA category because it's my lower level.

First, I should understand what EA means here. It says that the expression is generally in line with the topic but isn't easy to understand in a few places. Sometimes there can be intentional mistakes like grammar or spelling errors, which make it look more student-like.

The essay topic is distance learning, so I need to cover its definition, how it's used today, maybe some challenges, and perhaps its benefits or issues. But since my level is lower, the sentences might not be very clear, there could be a few mistakes, and the vocabulary might be basic.

I remember that in previous examples, the essay started with an introduction explaining what distance learning is. Then it moved on to how technology has changed education, mentioning things like online platforms and digital devices. It talked about flexibility for students but also potential issues like distractions at home or lack of interaction between teachers and students.

In my case, I need to keep each sentence simple and clear where possible. Maybe start with a basic introduction, explain distance learning simply, talk about how it's used nowâ€”perhaps mention some examples without going too deep. Then discuss challenges in a straightforward way, maybe touch on distractions or the difficulty of interacting with teachers.

I should also make sure there are intentional mistakes. For example, using incorrect spellings like "disurbance" instead of "disturbance," or making a simple grammatical error. That would make it look more student-like as per the criteria.

Also, I need to keep the word count in check because EA is supposed to reflect only simple use of words and basic sentence patterns. So maybe aim for around 150-200 words if possible, but since this is a composition, perhaps longer than that.

I should structure it with an introduction, body paragraphs explaining what distance learning is, how it's done now, its challenges, and maybe some benefits or issues without getting too complicated. Each paragraph can be one to two sentences.

Let me outline:

1. Introduction: Briefly define distance learning.
2. Current practices: Mention platforms like online schools, video conferencing tools.
3. Challenges: Distractions, difficulty with technology.
4. Conclusion: Sum up the points, maybe hint at future changes.

Now, considering vocabulary for level 1. Words like "distance learning" itself, simple sentences, terms like "online platform," "video calls," "flexible schedule." Maybe avoid more complex words or longer phrases.

I should also ensure that some parts are intentionally incorrect to mimic a student's mistakes but not so much that it makes the essay incomprehensible beyond EA standards. For example, maybe write "disurbance" instead of "disturbance."

Let me think about grammar errors: perhaps missing apostrophes in contractions like "can't" or "should've." Maybe misuse prepositions like "on" instead of "at," although that might be more for lower levels.

I should also make sure the essay flows logically, even if some sentences aren't perfect. Each point should transition smoothly to the next.

Now, putting it all together with these points in mind.

Distance learning is a way people learn without being at school or university. It often uses the internet and electronic tools to teach. Today, more people are using this method because of technology. Some schools have online lessons, and students can watch videos and listen to lessons.

However, there's some challenges with this kind of learning. One problem is that it's hard to focus when you're not at school. Also, sometimes it's hard to talk to teachers face-to-face. You might also get tired easily because you don't have a break like in class.

In the future, more schools will probably use distance learning. But for now, it's still new and has some issues that need work on.
