Okay, so I need to write an essay about distance learning at my school. I'm supposed to act as a student with an English level 1, which means my writing should be quite basic and have lots of mistakes.

First, I'll think about what distance learning is. It's when you learn online from home instead of going to school regularly. So maybe the essay will start by explaining what it is in simple terms.

I should include some examples or reasons why schools are using distance learning now. Maybe talk about how the pandemic affected education and how schools adapted. I remember hearing about online classes being used a lot during that time.

Then, perhaps discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning. For example, you can learn at your own pace which is good, but it might be harder to stay focused without a teacher's guidance. Also, not everyone has access to good internet or technology, so some students might struggle more than others.

I should also mention how teachers are adapting to this new way of teaching. Maybe they use different methods like videos and online tools. And don't forget about the support systems in place for students who need help.

Wait, I'm supposed to keep it simple because my English is at level 1. So maybe instead of using complex sentences or advanced vocabulary, I'll stick with basic words and very short sentences where possible.

Also, since there are specific instruction points given (like 10 points), perhaps the essay should cover those in a straightforward manner without getting too detailed.

I need to make sure that each paragraph is clear but not too complicated. Maybe use bullet points or numbered lists if allowed, but I think just short paragraphs will work better for level 1.

Let me outline:
- Introduction: Define distance learning simply.
- History and reasons for its use (pandemic example).
- How it works in our school.
- Advantages: flexibility, convenience.
- Disadvantages: lack of face-to-face interaction, technical issues.
- Support systems available.
- Conclusion: Summarize the benefits and mention future possibilities.

I should also make sure to keep paragraphs short and sentences simple. Maybe use words like 'sometimes,' 'usually,' or 'often' a lot because they are common in low-level English.

Oh, I almost forgot! The essay needs to be about 150-200 words. So I have to be concise but cover all the points. Let me make sure each part is just enough to touch on without being too wordy.

Alright, time to put it all together in simple language, avoiding complex structures and grammar errors.

Distance learning is a way of studying from home using online methods. Sometimes, this means watching videos or reading materials at your own pace. During the pandemic, many schools switched to this method because not everyone can attend classes regularly.

In our school, distance learning works by having lessons online. Teachers often use simple sentences and short explanations so it's easier to understand. Some days you might have video lessons, while other days are for interactive activities like answering questions or doing small projects.

Advantages of distance learning include the ability to learn at your own time, which can be very flexible. You can usually ask questions if you don't understand something, and sometimes teachers use online tools to help explain topics better.

However, it's not always easy. Without face-to-face interaction with teachers or classmates, it can feel a bit lonely. Also, not everyone has the same technology at home, so some students might find it harder than others.

Despite these challenges, there are support systems in place for those who need help. Our school offers extra resources and communication tools to ensure everyone feels supported.

In conclusion, distance learning gives us flexibility and convenience but also comes with its own set of challenges. With the right support, though, it can be a good way to continue learning even if you're not at school.
