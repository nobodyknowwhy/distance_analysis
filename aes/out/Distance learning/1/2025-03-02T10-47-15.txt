Okay, I need to write an essay about distance learning. As a student at Level 1 English, I should use simple words and basic sentence structures. Let me start by outlining what distance learning is.

First, it's online learning from home. I can mention how students access classes via the internet. Maybe talk about different devices like laptops or tablets being used. Then explain that assignments and tests are sent through email or a Learning Management System. 

I should include how students submit work and receive feedback online too. Also, talk about flexibility with studying at home without needing to go to school. But there might be challenges, like not having access to a computer if you don't have one at home.

Wait, I'm supposed to keep it simple for Level 1. So maybe avoid complex sentences or structures. Let me check each point again: online classes, devices used, assignments via email, submitting work online, feedback, and home-based flexibility with potential challenges like no computer access.

I think that covers the main points. Now I'll try to put them into simple English without making it too complicated.

Distance learning is a way to study online from home. You can attend classes using your computer or tablet. Your teacher sends lessons through email or a special system called a Learning Management System. You do homework and take tests by uploading files via email or the same system. After submitting your work, you get feedback from your teacher online. One advantage is that you can study at home without going to school. However, some students might not have access to a computer if they don't own one at home.
