Alright, so I need to help this user who wants me to act as a student writing an essay on "Distance Learning" at English level 1. First, I should understand what level 1 entails based on their instructions.

Looking at the standards they provided, Level 1 has numerous vocabulary and grammatical errors that really affect comprehension or a low word count with simple words and basic sentences. So the response needs to be quite basic but still cover the topic.

I'll start by choosing key points about Distance Learning. I should keep it simple: definition, convenience during pandemics, challenges like tech issues, and maybe future implications. 

Now, for vocabulary, since it's a low level, words should be very basic. Instead of "revolutionized", maybe just say "changed a lot". Instead of "challenges", perhaps use "difficulties".

Grammar-wise, I need to make sure sentences are simple with clear structures. Maybe start with main points and then expand slightly.

I'll structure the essay with an introduction, two body paragraphs on convenience and challenges, and a conclusion. Each paragraph will have just one or two sentences to keep it simple.

Also, including specific examples like Zoom classes can help, but since it's level 1, I might avoid more complex terms.

Finally, I should make sure there are intentional errors in grammar and spelling to fit the student's style as per the user's instructions.

**Distance Learning**  

Distance learning is a way of studying without going to a school or college. It allows people to learn from home. This type of learning has been used during the pandemic because many schools could not stay open. Many students think itâ€™s convenient because they can study at their own time and place. However, some people may find it difficult to focus when they are not in a classroom. Also, there are technical problems like internet issues that might happen. Overall, distance learning is changing how we learn and teach in schools.
