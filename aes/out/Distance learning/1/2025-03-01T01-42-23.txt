Alright, so I need to help this user by generating an essay on distance learning. But wait, they also mentioned acting as a student at English level 1. That means the response should be simple and have grammatical errors that might affect understanding.

Hmm, the composition needs to reflect a low level of English proficiency. Maybe using basic vocabulary and very short sentences. I should avoid complex structures and ensure clarity isn't compromised because of mistakes or multiple inconsistencies.

Let me break down the topic: Distance learning is online learning without face-to-face contact between students and teachers. I'll explain it in simple terms, perhaps mention challenges like limited interaction and technical issues. 

I need to make sure there are errors that would a student at this level might make, such as using incorrect grammar or spelling. Also, maybe some sentences will be run-on or have multiple mistakes.

Let me structure the essay: introduction explaining what distance learning is, then talk about its challenges like technical problems and communication barriers. Next, mention benefits despite these issues, ending with a conclusion that sums up the points.

I should keep each paragraph short to maintain clarity. Words might include "students", "teachers", "technological issues", etc. Also, maybe avoid some complex words so it stays at a basic level.

Alright, putting it all together in simple language with intentional errors here and there.

Distance learning is a way of teaching where students don’t meet face to face with their teachers or classmates. Instead, they use the internet or other technology to learn from home. It’s like learning from school but through pictures, videos, and written information instead of talking directly.

One thing about distance learning is that it can be hard because you might not get as much help from your teacher if you have questions. Sometimes the internet doesn’t work well, which makes it even harder to learn. Also, it’s not always easy to stay motivated when you’re studying on your own without other students around.

Even though distance learning can be challenging, I think there are good things about it. For example, you can study at any time you want and don’t have to go to school every day. But overall, I find it a bit confusing because sometimes the instructions aren’t clear or there are too many mistakes in the materials.

In conclusion, distance learning is different from normal school but has its pros and cons. It’s not always easy to understand everything because of the limited interaction with teachers and classmates.
