Okay, so I'm supposed to help write an essay on "Distance Learning" at a level 1 English proficiency. I remember from earlier that Level 1 is pretty basic. The user provided some criteria for each grade level, and they want me to act as a student who writes according to these standards.

First, I need to understand what the topic entails. Distance learning refers to education where students don't meet in a physical classroom; it's usually done online or through recorded materials. It can be challenging because it requires self-discipline and good internet access, among other things.

Since this is for Level 1, the essay should use very simple vocabulary and basic sentence structures. Maybe start with an introduction that defines distance learning simply. Then perhaps a couple of body paragraphs explaining its challenges, maybe some examples or personal thoughts on how difficult it can be. Finally, conclude by suggesting ways to make it easier.

I need to keep sentences short and avoid complex words. Let me think about how to structure this:

1. Introduction: Define distance learning.
2. Challenges: Internet issues, self-discipline needed, technical problems.
3. Conclusion: Suggest using reliable sources or tools like Zoom for better focus.

But I have to make sure the language is very basic. For example, instead of "Internet connection," maybe say "can't get online." Instead of "self-discipline," use a more basic term like "staying focused."

I should also check if there are any Level 1 composition examples from before to model after. But since I can't look them up now, I'll proceed with my understanding.

Now, putting it all together in simple sentences:
- Distance learning is when you learn online without meeting someone face-to-face.
- It's hard because sometimes the internet doesn't work or you don't know much about using computers.
- You need to stay focused and keep doing your homework every day.
- To make it better, use good internet and maybe ask a parent for help.

I think that covers the main points. Now I'll write the essay following these thoughts with simple language.

Distance learning is when you learn online without meeting someone face-to-face. It can be hard because sometimes your internet doesn't work or you don't know much about using computers. You need to stay focused and keep doing your homework every day. To make it better, use good internet connection and maybe ask a parent for help if needed.
