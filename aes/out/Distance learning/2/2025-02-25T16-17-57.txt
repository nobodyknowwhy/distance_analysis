Okay, I need to write an essay about distance learning. Since my English level is around 2 out of 5, I should keep it simple and avoid using complex vocabulary or grammar structures. The composition needs to have more errors but still be understandable.

I'll start with a friendly greeting, maybe asking if the reader has experience with online school. Then, I'll explain what distance learning is in my own words—using video calls and online tools instead of going to class. I should mention how it's helpful for students who can't attend school or have busy schedules.

Next, I'll talk about the challenges, like being less interactive compared to face-to-face classes. Maybe include that some teachers might not be as engaged because they can't see the students. Also, note any difficulties with staying focused and keeping up without a physical classroom environment.

I should also highlight positive aspects, such as flexibility in choosing when to study or learning from home. Then, I'll give my opinion—maybe support for distance learning but cautioning against relying solely on it without other resources like live classes.

Finally, wrap it up with a question that invites the reader's thoughts and a thank you. I need to make sure sentences are clear but not too complex, maybe use some repetition or simpler structures. Also, include a few intentional errors as per the requirement to mimic a student's work.

**Distance Learning**

Hello! I hope you’re doing well. Have you ever thought about what it’s like to learn in a different way? Sometimes schools call it "distance learning." It means using the internet or video calls instead of going to school every day.

I think distance learning is good because some people can’t go to school because they live far away or have busy schedules. With online classes, you can learn from home and watch videos or read books on your own time.

But I also think it’s different from regular school. In a normal classroom, you can ask questions face-to-face with your teacher. With distance learning, the teacher can’t see you as much, so they might not know if you’re understanding things properly. Also, sometimes it’s hard to stay focused when you don’t have someone else watching you at school.

I like how flexible distance learning is though! You can study at any time and take breaks when you need them. It also helps if you’re traveling or don’t have enough time for classes.

Overall, I think distance learning is a good way to learn, but it’s important not to rely on it completely without other ways to study like having live classes sometimes.
