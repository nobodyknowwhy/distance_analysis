Okay, I need to write an essay on "Distance Learning." Since my English level is 3, I should keep it simple and avoid complex structures. Let me start by outlining what distance learning is.

First, maybe explain that it's online teaching and learning over the internet. Then talk about why people use it—like when they can't go to school or work because of COVID-19. 

I should mention how students stay connected through video calls and message apps. Also, note the challenges like staying motivated without face-to-face interaction.

Don’t forget about the benefits too, such as flexibility with study times and access to more courses online. But also include some downsides—maybe technical issues or lack of personal interaction.

I need to keep sentences short and use basic vocabulary. Maybe avoid complex words and stick to simple ones. Let me structure it: introduction explaining what distance learning is, why it's popular now, challenges, and benefits.

**Distance Learning**

Distance learning is a way people study without going to school or work in person. It uses the internet to teach and learn through computers or special devices.

During COVID-19, many schools and companies switched to this method because not everyone could stay at home or go to work. Now it’s very popular for those who can’t meet others face-to-face.

Students use video calls and message apps to talk with their teachers and classmates even when they’re far away.

Some challenges include staying motivated since there are no classes together, but people usually try hard. Also, some may miss activities that happen in person.

Distance learning is good because it gives people more time to study and access more courses online. However, not everyone likes it because they feel less connected with others.
