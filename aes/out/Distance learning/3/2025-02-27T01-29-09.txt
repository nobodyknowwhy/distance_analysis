Alright, I need to help the user who wants me to act as a student at English level 3. They provided an example composition about distance learning that follows the VG standard—frequent errors and basic vocabulary. 

First, I should analyze what the user is asking for. They want an essay on 'Distance Learning' written in their current language level, which is described by these standards: VG means lots of lexical or grammatical errors, complex expressions are predominant, etc.

I notice that the example given uses simple structures and has a lot of repetitive phrases. So, I need to replicate that tone but ensure it's my own work. The composition should have frequent mistakes like subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect tenses, and overused vocabulary like "help."

I'll start by outlining the essay: introduction about the shift from traditional education, then reasons why distance learning is effective, its challenges, future perspectives, conclusion. 

But since it's a VG level, I need to make many mistakes here. Maybe mix up tense forms, use repetitive phrases for effectiveness, and avoid complex vocabulary.

I should also include intentional grammatical errors, misspellings, or incoherent sentences as per the user's note. Let me think of common mistakes: using "they're" instead of "is," incorrect past tense, etc.

I need to ensure that the composition is coherent but filled with these errors. The introduction and conclusion will be weak because of lack of depth, supporting points are minimal, and transitions between paragraphs might not connect well.

Let me draft an example, keeping it simple and error-prone. I'll use short sentences, repetitive phrases like "helping students learn," "bridging gaps in education." Also, avoid complex structures; keep it straightforward but with mistakes.

I should check that the content is about distance learning: its benefits, challenges, future impact. But due to errors, some points might be unclear or incorrect.

Finally, I'll review the example to ensure it meets all the VG criteria and fits within the essay topic.

**Distance Learning**

In recent years, the way we learn has changed a lot because of technology. More and more people are using online classes instead of going to school in person. This is called distance learning.

I think distance learning is helpful for everyone. It helps students who have jobs or family responsibilities. They can study at home or in their free time. Also, it makes education accessible to people who live far away from big schools.

But I also think there are some problems with online classes. Some teachers don’t explain things well. And sometimes the internet doesn’t work well, so you can’t get help when you need it. Plus, it’s hard to stay focused without a classroom.

In the future, maybe distance learning will become even better. More schools might use video calls and better technology. But for now, I think it’s important to remember that online classes are here to stay because they work for many people.
