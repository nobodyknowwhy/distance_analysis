Okay, I need to help this user who provided an example composition about distance learning at level 3. Their instructions were clear—write a composition according to the specified levels for each grade.

First, I should note that they're asking me to generate another text on 'Distance Learning' but at different proficiency levels: VG, LF, and EA. They also included the previous example as a reference. My task is to create compositions that reflect these different English language levels accurately.

Starting with VG level—frequent lexical or grammatical errors in complex expressions. So I should use more advanced vocabulary inaccurately and maybe some run-on sentences or repetitive structures. Words like "technological advancements" might be used correctly but combined in awkward ways, leading to errors.

For LF level, the text should still be fluent but with stiffer structural transitions. Maybe using more passive voice constructions or repeating phrases to maintain structure without natural flow. I need to ensure coherence while keeping it fluid enough for a fluent reader.

EA is the general consistency—content is relevant and understandable, though with some intentional mistakes like misspellings or simple grammar errors. This allows for a student approach where they might make small errors but still convey their points clearly.

I'll structure each composition accordingly, making sure to highlight each level's specific characteristics without overlapping too much. The examples provided by the user will serve as a good guide on how to achieve the desired levels.

Certainly! Below is an example of compositions written at different English proficiency levels (VG, LF, EA) for the topic "Distance Learning."

### **VG Level**
**Composition:**

Distance learning has become more popular in recent years. It allows people to study without leaving their homes. One advantage is that students can attend school from anywhere they want. However, some people think it is not as good as traditional schools because teachers cannot see the students. Also, students have less face-to-face interaction with classmates.

I believe distance learning has its benefits and challenges. For example, students can learn at their own pace, but it requires self-discipline to stay focused on their studies. Another thing is that internet connectivity can sometimes be a problem. Overall, I think distance learning can work well for some people but may not suit everyone.

### **LF Level**
**Composition:**

Distance learning has grown in popularity recently. It lets students study from home instead of going to school. One advantage is flexibility because students can learn at their own pace and on their own time. However, teachers cannot see students face-to-face, which might make it harder for them to monitor progress or answer questions.

Some people say distance learning isn’t as good as traditional schools because there’s less interaction between teachers and students. Also, it can be difficult for students to stay motivated without the support of classmates. Despite these challenges, I think distance learning has its place in education.

### **EA Level**
**Composition:**

Distance learning is a way people study without going to school. It allows students to learn from home, which is great because they don’t have to worry about traveling or missing classes. One benefit is that you can attend school from anywhere, which is helpful for busy schedules.

But some people think it’s not as good as regular schools because teachers can’t see the students and there’s less interaction with classmates. I think distance learning has its pros and cons. For example, students can work at their own pace, but they might struggle without face-to-face help from teachers or friends.

Overall, I think distance learning works well for some people but isn’t perfect for everyone. It depends on how motivated the student is and if they have a good internet connection to stay connected with their teachers and classmates.
