Alright, so I have this user query where someone wants me to act as a student at an English level 3 and write a composition about distance learning. They provided specific feedback on what each grade level looks like.

First, I need to understand the requirements clearly. The essay topic is "Distance Learning," and depending on the grade, the text's quality varies. For VG, there are lots of lexical or grammatical errors using basic vocabulary. LF has fluent expressions but stiff transitions. EA is consistent with the topic without major issues, allowing some intentional mistakes.

The user wants me to write a composition according to these levels. They also gave an example at level 3 with specific feedback on what needs improvement, like starting sentences and grammar errors in complex structures.

Now, considering my role as a student at English Level 3, I should aim for a text that's understandable but has some basic mistakes. Maybe using simple vocabulary, common sentence structures, and frequent grammatical errors to reflect the VG level description.

I'll start by outlining what distance learning is: online education from home or elsewhere. Then talk about how it's different from traditional classrooms—maybe fewer distractions, more flexible hours? But also mention challenges like technical issues, self-discipline required, etc.

I should include positive aspects too, like allowing people to attend schools even if they can't go in person during emergencies, and the convenience of learning at your own pace. 

Now, thinking about grammar: I might use passive voice more often, misuse articles or prepositions, have repetitive phrases, or complex sentences with errors.

I also need to make sure the essay flows logically from introduction to challenges, benefits, and conclusion. Maybe start with a hook about how distance learning changed lives during crises like COVID-19.

I should end with a reflection on its impact and suggest ways it could improve in the future, maybe by addressing technical issues or mental health support for students.

Let me structure this into an essay outline:
- Introduction: Definition of Distance Learning.
- Challenges: Technical issues, lack of interaction, self-discipline.
- Benefits: Flexibility, accessibility during emergencies, personalization.
- Conclusion: Overall impact and future improvements.

Now, I'll draft the text using simple language, intentional mistakes to fit Level 3. For example, "It's when you learn online from home or other places." Maybe mix some tenses incorrectly or use repetitive phrases.

I need to ensure that the essay is around 150-200 words as per the example provided.

**Distance Learning: A New Way of Learning**  

Distance learning has become a new way of learning. It means people can learn from home or other places far away. It’s like when you use your computer to attend school online, even though you’re not physically in that classroom.

I think distance learning is different because it allows people to study at their own time and pace. For example, if I don’t feel well on Monday, maybe I can skip class then or watch the lessons later. But sometimes it’s hard because I miss the interaction with my teacher and classmates when they are all together in a classroom.

Another thing is that distance learning often uses online tools like videos and messages. It also needs people to have good internet connections so everything works well. I sometimes forget to check my devices, and it makes me feel confused if the videos don’t work on my phone.

I think one of the best things about distance learning is that you can study from anywhere in the world. For example, my friend in another country has a class every day, but she doesn’t have to go far because everything is online. It’s also helpful when we are busy and can’t go to school in person.

However, I don’t like how it makes me feel lonely because I can’t talk with my classmates as much. Maybe I should try to join some online groups or make friends online so I don’t feel alone.

In conclusion, distance learning is a good way of studying when you can’t go to school every day or when there are natural disasters that stop schools from working. It also helps people who need to work while studying because they can learn at their own time. But it’s still hard sometimes because of the technical problems and missing interactions with others.  

This is my thoughts about distance learning.
