Alright, so I need to help this user who wants me to act as a student at English level 3 and write an essay on distance learning. The composition should have the VG category, which means it should have frequent lexical or grammatical errors in complex expressions and use basic vocabulary.

First, I'll consider what the user is asking for. They provided four categories: VG, LF, EA, and something else (SP). Since they specified using VG, my essay needs to reflect that level of language proficiency.

I need to structure the essay properlyâ€”introduction, body paragraphs, conclusion. The topic is distance learning, so I should cover its definition, how it's used now, challenges, benefits, etc., but keep each part simple because of the VG requirement.

In the introduction, maybe start with a sentence defining distance learning and then explain why it's important today. Keep it straightforward, using basic vocabulary.

For the body paragraphs, I can talk about how it has become more common due to technological advancements, like online platforms. Then mention some challenges such as lack of personal interaction or distractions at home. Finally, highlight the benefits like flexibility and access to education.

The conclusion should summarize the points without introducing new information, emphasizing the positive aspects despite challenges.

I have to be careful with grammar and vocabulary. Use simple sentences, avoid complex structures, and maybe use repetitive phrases if that helps convey the message clearly. Also, make sure each paragraph transitions smoothly using words like "however" or "in addition."

Let me check for any errors. I'll keep an eye on the word count to ensure it's around 150-200 words as per usual essays.

Wait, did the user specify a word limit? They didn't, so maybe aim for about three paragraphs with each focusing on different aspects: definition and growth, challenges, benefits.

I think that covers everything. Now I can draft the essay accordingly.

**Distance Learning**

Distance learning is a way of education where students learn from home instead of going to school. It has become more common because of the internet and technology today. More people are using it now because they need to study at their own time or live in places that do not have schools.

However, distance learning can be hard sometimes because the teacher cannot see the students directly. This makes it harder for teachers to help them when they have problems with their work. Also, some students may find it harder to focus on their studies without being surrounded by classmates.

Despite these challenges, I think distance learning is a good way of studying. It allows people who cannot go to school to still learn and get a degree or education. It also gives students more time to study and do other things they need.
