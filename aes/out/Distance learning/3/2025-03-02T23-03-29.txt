Okay, so I need to help this user who is acting as a student at an English level 3. They provided some feedback on how to structure their composition based on different levels (VG, LF, EA). The task is to write an essay about distance learning.

First, I should understand the user's requirements. They want a composition that reflects their current English level, which is around 1-5. Specifically, they mentioned that it should have frequent lexical or grammatical errors in complex expressions and use basic vocabulary mostly.

Looking at the example response provided earlier, it was an essay structured into three paragraphs: introduction, body with two main points, and conclusion. The language used was simple but somewhat repetitive, which fits the VG level description.

I need to make sure that my composition is similar in style—using straightforward sentences, basic vocabulary, and some intentional mistakes as per the student's note. I should avoid complex structures and focus on clear points without overcomplicating the grammar or lexicon.

The topic is distance learning, so I'll cover key aspects like its origins during COVID-19, its benefits such as flexibility for students with busy schedules or those in remote areas, challenges including technical issues and lack of face-to-face interaction, and future implications regarding education accessibility.

I should ensure that each paragraph transitions smoothly but perhaps use some repetition to maintain simplicity. I might include examples like online tools not being available everywhere or how virtual classrooms can still foster engagement through certain activities.

Also, since it's a composition for an English level 3 student, I'll keep sentences short and use common vocabulary without trying to be sophisticated. Maybe use phrases that are frequently used but express ideas clearly enough for someone at this level.

I need to avoid using complex sentence structures or advanced vocabulary. Instead, focus on the basics—like explaining distance learning as a method where students attend classes remotely. Highlight both the pros and cons in an easy-to-understand way.

Finally, wrap it up by summarizing how distance learning has both positive and negative aspects but is here to stay with some improvements. Make sure each point flows logically into the next without using overly complex connectors.

Alright, putting all this together should create a composition that meets the VG level criteria as per the user's instructions.

Distance learning has become an important part of education for many people in recent years. It allows students to study from home or attend classes online, which can be very flexible. One advantage is that it gives students more time to work on their studies without worrying about traveling or being away from home.

However, distance learning also has some challenges. For example, not everyone has access to good internet or the necessary tools at home. This can make it harder for some students to keep up with their classes. Additionally, studying online requires discipline because there are no face-to-face interactions between teachers and students.

In the future, more schools might use distance learning because it can help reach students in remote areas who wouldn’t have access to education otherwise. But both sides of this issue need to be considered when deciding how to improve distance learning for everyone.
