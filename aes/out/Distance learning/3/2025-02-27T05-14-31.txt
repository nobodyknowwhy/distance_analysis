Okay, so I need to help this user who wants me to act as a student at English level 3. They provided an example response and want me to write about "distance learning." Hmm, first, I should figure out what aspects of distance learning are important. Maybe the shift in education due to COVID-19? That's a current topic and likely relevant.

Since the user is at level 3, their writing might have some errors but still convey ideas. They mentioned using frequent lexical or grammatical errors and basic vocabulary. So I should keep sentences simple but make sure they are clear enough for someone at that level.

Let me outline key points: definition of distance learning, its purpose during COVID-19, positive impacts like flexibility and access to education, challenges such as tech issues and lack of face-to-face interaction, and maybe a conclusion suggesting continued use in the future with improvements.

I need to write in English but make it easy to understand. Maybe avoid complex structures. Use present tense for current situations and past tense where appropriate. Also, include some intentional mistakes or awkward phrasing to reflect level 3 errors as per the user's instructions.

Let me start drafting: "Distance learning has become a new way of learning." That sounds good. Then mention how it allows people to study from home during COVID-19. Next, talk about its benefits like flexibility and access to courses that might not be available locally. But also note challenges like limited interaction between students or technical difficulties.

I should ensure the composition flows well with clear transitions. Maybe use words like "however" or "in conclusion." Keep sentences short and avoid complex vocabulary where possible.

Wait, is there anything else? Oh, I need to make sure it's coherent but still shows some of the student mistakes intentionally. Maybe mix some correct grammar with minor errors to simulate a level 3 response.

**Distance learning has become a new way of learning.** It allows people to study from home instead of going to school every day. During COVID-19, many schools closed their doors because of health reasons, so more and more students chose distance learning. This kind of learning is useful because it gives students the chance to learn at their own pace. They can watch videos and listen to lessons whenever they want.

However, some people think that distance learning isn’t as good as traditional school. They might say it’s harder to stay focused or keep track of what you’ve learned if you’re not meeting other students face-to-face. Also, sometimes the internet doesn’t work well, which can make learning harder. But overall, distance learning seems to help people learn even when schools are closed. Maybe in the future, more people will use it because it’s becoming more common and better with technology improving.
