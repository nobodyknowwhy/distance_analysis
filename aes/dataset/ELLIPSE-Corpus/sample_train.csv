It's necessary start to think in the future doctors, start to pass the learning to the next generation, the theories, and the grow of the modern medicine.

This partnership can teach me what the doctor learn all this years. The learn of the doctors can help me to learn why the things are doing this way, for example em de patient stop to breathe the doctor has to put a tub to the patient start to breathe; and if this don't work the doctor has to do a mini-surgery. The reason why when some one brake a leg the time of the recuperation is different; the reason why when a car chars happen the patient has to went to a T.C. The reason why cancer happen, if it is in our DNA or can happen with anyone.

This partnership can help me to learn the theories. The theories of the causes for the repenting blinding, or way some patients wake up to the coma and other don't. How will be possible in the future faith with the cancer and the autism to help the people that have it; how its possible someone o broke the cervical walk again. If it's possible create a substitute to the glasses, what will be the percentage of people who have obesity in the future.

This partnership can help me to learn the grow of the modern medicine. Talk about how the treatment to the cancer cell can be done with radiation, and what can be done to change this process because of the negative effects in the humans body. Talk about the big number of surgery in the kids, and how it's possible do something do the recuperation be less painful to the kid and to the parents.

8,CD81F6CCE819,"I believe that self-esteem comes from achievement because the more a student work hard, the more achievements he/she get so when they receive more awards and/or achievements, it makes them to proud of their selves and build true self-esteem.

There are so much students who works hard, complete their work on time and also have a part time job after school, but they don't know how to build their true self-esteem so what they need to work is that they must be self confident because they can't build their self-esteem unless they're self confident.

Also, there are much more students who go to school and don't have a job or anything after school or during weekend and they're self confident, but don't know how to build their self-esteem.

So, students should try their best to receive achievements because it encourages and/or makes them to build their self-esteem.

Self-esteem is something that students can build it by theirsleves if they work hard, be punctual at school and have a checklist or a plan for what they should do first as a calender.

Students aren't working hard nowadays I have no idea that it's because technology makes them lazy or they don't want to plus they're not trying to achieve something at school.

I'm sick and tired of seeing these kind of students because if they just open their school backpack and at least study for two hours at home, they will receive a lot of achievements at school so that's how they can achieve their goals.

So, when it comes to build their true self-esteem, they need to work on achievements and become self confident first and then best version of their selves.

Teachers also have a role in this issue because I think students spend more time with their teacher compare to their parents in a week.

I don't mean teachers discuss with them to build either their self-esteem or self confidence unless the student is smart and curious to ask his/her teachers and peers about becoming like a person who has self confidence and already built his/her self-esteem.

But, at least they show students the right way to get achievements or achieve their goals so that would be enough, and students will start thinking about how to get achievements and then they'll probably start working on their self confidence and self-esteem.

In addition, when I came to the united states it was 2017, I didn't know any English and I didn't have any friends at school so everybody knows how hard it is to go to school and can not speak with anyone or don't have friends plus I was a shy guy.

When somebody was trying to talk to me, my face was becoming red and start blushing so it's all because I didn't have self confidence.

So, I am still trying my very best to learn the language and make some friends at school so I can play or do my work with them together.

That being said, now I can speak, write and read very well and I became so much more confidence, best version of myself, have a lot of friends, and so happy to attend school.

Overall, being self confident and working hard for achievements are like a key for building students self-esteem which comes from achievements.

Students should focus at school or wherever else they study so they get achievements which helps them to build their self-esteem.

Students also should be encouraged by their parents to build their self-esteem as well as by their selves unless they're self confident in life.

9,DC56EF65D59D,"""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm""

I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, the life consists in make mistakes, nobody is perfect, everyone in any moment of our life we failure, but the purpose it's stand up with faith and enthusiasm, and doesn't give up; failure is not something bad like many people think, that's the reason why too much people feel lees than other's, when they make failure's in they life, so we resolve our mistakes with sadness, without enthusiasm, or fear of what people can say, believe in yourself is the key of an better life, and failure in our life it's just the teacher of our own future.

Churchill's statement bring a beautiful statement of what successful can be signify in our life, so success it's something what everyone can obtain in any situation, however, it's the most wonderful opportunity for our own willingness,while, in my other hand failure means practice of our own future, because failure it's just the perfect manner to learn, to be better with the past of the time. How your going to teach your children's, if you didn't make mistakes? Failure make people with experience, ""if you don't make mistakes,you don't learn"" and you can't teach other people, when they are in warning to make the same mistakes that you did before, this is a great example of family, so you need to be the example of your children's helping to show the danger, but as well the wonderful manner to see the failure with enthusiasm to commence again.

The failure make better people? absolutely, because mistakes sample the things what we didn't wanted to see before; failure to failure probably it's tired, but have a great recompense; failure prepare our own life, for example if we failure the test, probably next time we are going to study better than the first time, but we get a great experience to see with better perspective than before. The point of failure is what we need to live failure in our own life, for understand and see with different perspective than before, failure create a maturity person with experience, and big knowledge;however this great statement it's a example of persevered,progress, and growth in our own life to get experience, maturity, productivity, and fortress.

My conclusion is basically in the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, so make mistakes is no bad it's part of life, just don't give up and show that we can be better, we can do better than before;failure is the teacher of your future, don't be fear on what people can be say about your decision's, or you manner of see your failure, it's fine make mistakes ""we learn something new"",but it's important the manner that we see it, with enthusiasm or sadness?,because we continue,we start again,and we can get better results. Failure it's the experience of the teacher, of a persevering, progressing, and productivity person,life it's not perfect, but depends the perspective in what way do you see life, so"" we need to make mistakes to be the teacher of the tomorrow"".",Female,12,Hispanic/Latino,462,571,533,9,5,106.6,59.12660944,30.82311734,176,571,Independent,Not economically disadvantaged,Success and failure,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,train
10,B948405746B5,"Many students like to spend time with their friends in the school. Specially high schools are good places for students to learn and get fun with their friends. By the way some students are coming to school just for the pass their classes and work hard to graduate with high grades. I think graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years from a high school would be good for these students. Because they can go to college/university early, or work 1 year full time in a job to save money after graduated from high school or get more time to think about their career desicion.

First of all a student who graduated from high school in three years can attend to a college early. This means this student also can graduate one year early from the college and start his career early. If this student already decided to which college or university that he wants to go and what career he wants to do, this can be good for him. Also, student can understand how college classes are.

Second reason for to choose graduate early is save money for college/university. Some students who graduated from high school don't go to college/university directly. These students choose to work in a job one or two years full time to save money for college/university. This is a good option for the students who doesn't have money to pay for college/university or who doesn't want to be dependent to his family. Some families don't have money to pay their childrens' school. In this kind of situations students choose to wait one or two years instead of go to college/university directly.

Another reason to graduate early from high school is to get a extra year to make a desicion about career and college/university. Some students think it is hard to choose the right career for them in high school because when they graduateded from university their careers is going to be their whole life. Like an example sometimes students choose the job according to the classes that they liked in their high school but after they go to college/university they understand this career is not interesting more to them. According to the scientistists 35% of the college/university students decide to change their career in their freshman or sophomore year in the university. This shows that students need to think carefully while they make a decision about their careers. Also the career that a student choose effects the college/university that he wants to go because many students choose the university that gives good education and opportunites to this students about their careers that they choosed.

In conclusion I think graduate one year early from high school is a good idea for the students who wants to go to college/university early. Another reason is save money to pay college/university and final reason is to get a extra time to make a desicion about right career and school. I believe also to study and get prepared better for SAT

to get a higher score can be an extra reason. Graduate early from high school is a good idea but also can be hard for all students.

11,9715AAF5B952,"Have you thought about your first impression of someone and did it change or not? because our first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at a new school and when you go to an interview for job.

First, first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at new school because people can look at you by the way you are quite, shy, and serious. But once they start to get to know you they start realizing that you are talkative, loud, and fun to hangout with. Their first impression of you starts to change. For example, when I met Generic_Name I thought she was ignorant, rude, and selfish but when I started to hangout with her I noticed that she was a sweet and caring girl. And we became really good friends even my first impression of her from the beginning changed.

Second, first impression are possible to change when you go to an interview at work because when you arrive at the interview it may seem that don't have the courage to work by the way you act. Meanwhile those impressions start to change because they notice that you actually want to work and you want to put an effort on the job. For example, When I went to an interview for a job the manager thought that I didn't actually wanted to work and that I wouldn't take it serious just by the way I look. Later on he realized that I actually wanted the job even that I would take it serious. In other hand some people think that by the way I talk or my face impression, people think that I won't get the job because I would not take it serious but they are wrong because once they start to get to know me. They start realizing that I actually want the job.

In conclusion, first impression are actually possible to change when people are making new friends at school and when you get an interview for job because we need to get to know each other better, instead of letting our first impressions be right.

12,82BA3E4396CC,"Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling.

Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.

Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.

Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came.

Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains.

13,EDA0DCA3FC41,"I don't think that school districts should allow students to graduate early. I believe that this is a bad idea because students have to take more classes than what you usually take, students would have to stay after school or maybe even take summer school, so they can get enough credits to graduate early, and students would be very stressed having to learn all this material for each of their classes, since they won't be taking any electives. For these reasons, I don't think school districts should allow students to graduate early.

Students who are graduating early, will have to take extra classes during the school year, so that they can earn the credits for their classes. In many schools, you have to have at least four credits in one subject, so that means the student will most likely have to take two classes of one subject to earn the credits for that one specific subject. Some students graduating early, might have a difficult time being all caught up in each of their classes, which can lead to them having to stay after school to take tutoring classes in case they don't understand the material being taught.

Most students, will either have to take school during the summer or they stay after school to take extra classes. Students who stay after or do summer school do this, so that they can earn all the credits they need to graduate early. Students who choose to do summer school don't have to take that many classes when they go back to school, since they already took some classes during the summer. Students who choose to stay after school to take extra classes, will have to stay in school longer, so they can learn all the material for the subjects that they are taking after school.

Students will be stressed and under pressure when it comes to learning and studying for each of their classes. They will be stressed because they're going to have to study for a lot of their classes, when they take tests and sometimes they can have tests in multiple classes on the same day, which means they are going to have to study for multiple classes. Same thing applies with homework, they will feel under pressure to get all their work done. They wouldn't be taking any electives, so that means all their classes will be hard, since elective classes are usually easy.

This is why I think that graduating early is a bad idea, because students will be very tired and stressed trying to catch up on school work. If you do four years of High School instead of three years, everything will go a lot slower than three years and also you will be less stressed, when it comes to catching up on school because you will have less classes to worry about. This is why it's better to do four years of High School.

A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home.

To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. The distraction is not because we don't want to do the work, but it's our minds. Everyone's minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work.

Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances,

football games, and pep rallies. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldn't go to a public school and decided to take online school instead.

Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldn't want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I don't know what else to do to not be bored at home. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons.

Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy.",Female,11,Hispanic/Latino,754,709,704,30,8,88.0,55.96522655,33.14527504,235,709,Independent,Economically disadvantaged,Distance learning,4.5,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,train
15,F90A6181BBCA,"In this world many of us make decisions by ourselves and others seek guidance to make decisions in their life. While some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life, but I think it is more beneficial if people make their own decisions because if people make their own decisions they will develop their self confidence and they will become responsible person. Also, if people make their own decisions they will have happier life in the the future.

It's true that by making our own decisions that we will develop our self confidence and become responsible person. If person make decision that decision might be hard, after making the decision the person will develop his or hers self confidence and they will become responsible for the decision that they made. For example, if one person decides to leave his parents house to live by his own, he will be responsible for himself because he decided not to live with his parents no more. This will help him to be responsible person because he has to take care of himself by his own. Another example can be, In school, Students choose their classes for next year by themselves. This will help them to develop their self confidence because they are deciding what is better for them or not by their own. Also, this will help them to decide and have a confidence in what they will major in the future. So, by making our own decisions we can develop our self confidence and become responsible person.

Secondly, It's also true that by making our own decisions we will be happy and have happier life. When people make important decisions by themselves and if they achieve their goal by making this decision they will become happy and they can have happier life. For instance, if one student decided not to go college, instead he wanted to become a soccer player. If the student worked hard and become a professional soccer player he will be happy and will have happier life because he decided to become a professional soccer player by himself instead of going college. Additionally, In school, When I was sophomore, I was choosing classes for next year and I decided to take classes that I thought that are important for me and that can help me for college. Then when I take the classes this year I was very happy of my decision because this classes helped me a lot. So, people should make their own decision because they will be happy and have happier life by the decision they made.

On the other hand, some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life because it helps them not to make wrong decisions, but I think that is wrong because if you always seek guidance to make decision in your life the decision that you made may not satisfy you in your future life. For example, if your parents advice you to make decision to become a doctor and if you made a decision to be a doctor by listening your parents ,in the future you might have bad life because being a doctor might not be part of your life. Also, you will experience difficulties in your life because your decision is influenced by others. So, people should make their own decision because it helps them to become better self confident person. By making our own decision we can gain a lot in our life.

Finally, people should make their own decision because it will help them to develop their self confidence and to become a better person by being responsible. Also, by making their own decision they will have a better life in the future. People should make their own decision to become better person by achieving their goals. Additionally, peoples have to make a decision by themselves because they can gain a lot in their life.

16,5132328226C2,"Afterschool Homework Club

Most students do not enjoy doing their homework at home; for it can get quite frustrating. A lot of students favorite part of their school day is going home, but some other students favorite part of the day is their afterschool club. Now teachers and students are volunteering to meet with people who have difficulty in subjects or who want to finish their homework early,but afterschool. I think it is great that people are staying afterschool to help other people with school work and learning. It is a good to be a part of an afterschool homework club because it makes teachers do what they're best at, it helps students understand certain things better, and a club made for troubled kids makes other kids not afraid to ask for help when they don't understand something.

A teachers main job is to teach their students common knowledge that they will need when they become independent adults. Although the main job for teachers is teaching, they can, and should, also inspire their students. With this afterschool club students will be inspired to help others when they see their own teachers helping others to better understand something. Feeling believed in is an amazing feeling that students will feel in the club. The teachers who are helping the students aren't getting paid to be their, they are volunteering to help the students because they believe that the student can learn and understand something better, with their help. The people who volunteer to help their students would also be helping their community. The smarter that the teachers make their students the brighter the future we're headed towards. Not only can the afterschool homework club help teachers do their job, but it can also give students the extra help that they need to understand a subject.

Learning and understanding something new is something a lot of people struggle with. Some people struggle with learning something new because the class period that they learned it in was too short. A lot of times when learning something new it is important to have time to understand it, and one class period is not long enough. The club would give students extra time to understand the subject, and possibly do the homework that the subject required. Doing homework at home can be stressful at times. A lot of times a home is loud and distracting, but with a one-on-one class with a teacher it would be quite and not distracting. There are different ways that a person learns best. Some people are visual learners and some are verbal learners. Some students dont understand what they're being taught because of the way its being taught. A visual learner could be learning verbally, and it might just be very confusing because of it being taught verbally. The club would have teachers teaching in the students proffered way. Because of students getting extra help, more students are becoming unafraid to ask for help when they have trouble understanding something.

This club makes students know that they aren't the only ones that have trouble in school. A lot of people feel dumb because they cant do something properly or even understand it, but with the club they would see that they aren't the only ones struggling to understand the subject. If a person that you knew was getting help from a teacher afterschool and the next day they completely understood the subject, wouldnt you want to go be a part of the club too? Most people think of afterschool clubs as a fun and relaxing activity to calm down their mind from their stressful day at school. Afterschool activities are like school, but it's fun, and it is exciting. Learning can be made fun in afterschool clubs because they have students all sharing their struggles and getting help for them. The afterschool homework club would be a safe place for all the people who are afraid to ask for help, but arent afraid to be a part of a group. The club makes people feel welcome, not alone, and so much more.

The afterschool homework club benefits all the people in the community. It benefits the students by giving them the help they need to succeed. It benefits the teachers by giving them a chance to inspire others to help each other. The afterschool homework club benefits the students parents because it prevents the students from coming home to complain about their homework that they dont understand.

17,D45494CE3D2E,"Human survival depends on technology, we can not live without it. Technology is used in our everyday lives, from the very moment we open our eyes to the end of the day when we go into our sleep. Technology has really advanced a whole lot in comparison from the first telephone made up, to todays modern devices. Technology may have a negative impact to it, since technology is everywhere it is almost impossible to keep out of reach. Young children start to us it to early in life, they get addicted and they cry if it is taken from them. Technology may have that negative affect but it has many positive affects that come from it as well.

The beginning of technology all starts back when the first telephone was created by Alexander Graham Bell. The telephone he had created is much different from the ones you see today in everyday use by millions of people. His creation of the telephone was like a brick, very big and heavy. That device was more of a at home used only kind of device, not something you could easily just carry around with you. his invention probably was not the most popular right away since everyone was so use to living with out one it was not much of a necessity. As time progressed other inventors took Graham bells invention and invested further into it, adding and taking away things it had. For one the size and weight of it was changed by a lot through out time as well as the capability of what you could do on it. At first it was used only to transfer calls to communicate with somebody verbally without having to be face to face or even at close distance with them. Many individuals wanted to be the inventor of a phone and there are more than one, therefore because of this there are different companies, not just one that produces electronic devices. Around the early 2000's Apple, which is one of the biggest electronic device companies had released the first Iphone. Everyone and everywhere all around the world people were purchasing Apples new product. Throughout the years Apple has made so many products for people to purchase from cell phones,earphone, tablets, computers, watches, portable chargers, to just about anything for people to buy that they may use in there everyday lives.

Though all these advancements in technology may have caused some negative impacts in life such as that children from a young age get addicted from them it has also helped them. Parents have a big impacts in this whether they decide to hand their children a electronic or not, most parents that do let them opporate a device usually have limitations in what they can do or watch and for how long. Letting young children use this technology isnt all bad, there are television shows that help them learn their shapes, colors, objects, movements and simply learn how to communicate with others before entering school, nothing wrong with being a little ahead of others. ABC mouse is one of many great resources online that help children with their education and it is also done in a fun way for them to learn and enjoy their studying.

Technology is used by everyone all around the world and even out in space! Everything around us is being technologically used by us, inside of our own homes and outside. Security cameras, the thermostat that keeps us warm in the comfort of our homes and AC that helps us cool down on hot sunny days, the foods and drinks we store away in our fridges and freezers, WiFi box, T.V(s), door bells, all of that technology and thats just in our homes. Outside everyday technology would be like he vehicle we use to get to our jobs, the traffic signals, GPS to help guide use to get to our desired destination. You have a paper due or something you really need information on whether it is school related or not and the library is closed or you just can not get in reach of one you can simply do your research from any location you may be in with a click and swipe on a screen like your cell phone or computer. Machines are technology used like those in hospitals that are seriously used for human survival when someone is terribly injured or a new baby is born. Technology is still progressing and it will only become more advanced through out time, everyday inventors and scientist use it to make new ways to cure up diseases, find out where they come from and how they can be prevented.

The creation of technology on our world has been very helpful to us all in every way possible, without it there are many possibilities of certain deaths and accidents that could have occurred if it did not exist. The amount of advancement that it had gotten to will only help it get greater so we can be prepared for future tragedies that we would not want this world to face. Technology has been an extremely positive thing that has happened in this world for millions possibly even billions of people who use it.
