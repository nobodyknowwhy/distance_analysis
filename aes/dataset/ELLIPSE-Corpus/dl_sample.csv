776FBF88E6FF,"Welll its going to be ah good beefit but in the same time it's a bad benefit to doing class in the house .

(03/10/2020).

The oportunity the not miss one class and be in you house is the best thing the can happen to one school students, this benefist the school and the students beacuse they never going to miss one day of school and the homeworks and tests to. In the actually some kids miss the school for be sicks, some familiar pass away ,they in vacation and they not return in time to the country , they miss the bus school and they can't go to the school beacuse they not have car ,oh they wake up late. This is a benefit because they can learn about the class oh activity and not miss homework oh test and be prepare for the next class in the school, and be in his house relaxing and be in a safe place and always have ready you homework oh test to next class and its ah good benefits to the people ho its in the hospital and can go to the school for ah broken legh oh medical condition .

But not everething it's good about this idea some kids maybe oh actually they gonna stop going to the school and stay in his house and skiping the school. this its going to affect them beacuse they can't sociable with other people ,they can have ah computer oh in his house, they not have wife oh cellfone and other guys oh kids will skip the online class to and go play video games,and they parents are not gonna have idea about what his kid did oh do, and during the test they can copy using this class peapers oh using his fone to find out the answers. ( In my case i will always if they give me the opportunity to online classes i will always stay in my house relaxing in my bed when i listening the class ) but in the end this option of learn in his house have his good and bad bennefits (some school in the united states are not using this becuse they not have personal wedsites and can garanteed if the student are going to use this ) .

( I have one idea in how they can do this in ah good way. The students ho miss the school need to call the school and inform why they not going to the school and need the have a parent in his house, then they send them the link of the online class and notify the parent if they are doing work, oh they are skiping the online classes, and they can have ah limet time of online classes so they can be focus to his work and doit on time and when they are doing ah test they doing the test in a video coferincing with one teacher if they and not chating oh copy during the test. ).

My personal opinion:

In my opinion its ah good offer becouse sometimes i miss the school bus and i can't go to the school becuse i not have ah car and i always miss the class,homework and tests, and this can be help me a lot to have all the work in time and be prepare for the next day of school and be ready take the class oh to take one test .

one sad fact:

In the intere world some kids can have this oportunity to have online classes in some countries around the world they not have the tecnology to do that so if they miss the school one its like they are missing one day of his life and fact even they are kids ho not are going to the school bacuse the parents not have money to send them to the school ( yep in some countries the education cost money and they not have free schools like united states ) and they have to work in one short age to help his family in my country was like this thaks to good i was alow to go to the school thanks to my mother and come her to the united states so when i come to the school her in united states and i hear students said i hate the school and i wanna be in home i remember my country and i said thanks to this country for give me free education (even in her they do video school conferencing to the people ho not coming to the school and i said wow , Even they do that for the students, and the students are doing protest to have more off days so what i try to said is always thanks to you parents for the education they are give to you and thaks always to you country to give you free education to you can be some one in you future and have a nice work and never ask why i not have this. and always think some in around the world not have the stuff the you have and always thanks to GOD for the stuff you have ( I always do that wen i wake up).

Extra fact:

In some countries i the world like China,South Korea,Russia... etc, the education in vidio its ilegaly in all school this is bacuse they think the education its have to be like the oll days paepar pencil and uniform (some schools in united states more in the private schools) and they not use laptops to do classes the have to read every single book and the attendence its obligatory what i read if you miss the school in that countries they punch you in the hands with one metal stinck ( like in some countries in south america) and the leave detention in the school and you have to writte in 10 oh 20 pages the i have to come to the school every day . sometimes they stay in the school all day bacuese they need study for ah test. I some countries ( South Korea ) its elegal have computers and cellphones in the school . in south america yeah they can cellphones and laptops in the schools but the problem its the internet so many people have to steall the wife to his neighbord.",Male,11,Hispanic/Latino,1032,1066,1071,18,11,97.36363636,32.14368206,24.95309568,266,1066,Independent,Not economically disadvantaged,Distance learning,1.5,1.5,1.5,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,train
1DB195AA7BE3,"Well the best option for my is what you attend the classes from home by way of online .

My reason or my thought is, what you cant learn, in online classes, and thought what you can do it , doing others wor,k in you free time, and the school has good ideas for student what take, classes like after school just in home . So in my position is that because if you work so is you cant take the class for one hours, and you work ,and is more benefit for myself but ,each person has diferent ideas .

Examples:

If you not have work is more time for you ,for what you keep doing you class online.

If you wnat the class . you has more time for to think best for work online and make a good work and your class.

With this examples are much more for what you take any option or my option what is the best or most better already is in you home .

If you not have time like time complete is for that what you take this option ya what has work and not time like for stay in the school all the time .

Others examples is whent you have 18 year old has to much resposabilities and others case it 's not easy .

I think whent a teacher said you need that class is for one reason, and you nedd take that class but you cant took with you teacher what, is most better for you. So and my opinion or my position is take class from home in online, and to much better what ,take video coferencing.

One reason because im take that option is because in my home is relax, and with food and alone and not voices and nothing, and in my home take my time for think most better i think is the most important for my work in home and i think what the work in online is not easy so need my time for to think, and good ideas and good answer, and the idea is what you learn with any option you take for this case . The student in this time has more option for any problem . One reason for what i take this option is for the time ya what much student are major or not have much time for coming a school because the work or others case. Other reasons what the student take this option is beacuse is home not in other pleace ya what not has ride or cars for take that class or classes en other pleace .

My intentions is what others student take this option what is classes from HOME because is the best ,option for any case too if you want free time is more easy for you take this class or classes home by way of online, and is more choice that idea and minus dificult just what in home or online you not have teacher for explain any question so for that reason is little complicate but not impossible make you work so you cant do it , forever you want , nothing is this life is impossible but too not is easy everthing is sacrifice. Abd you has see you work good and past the class sin difucult .

My reference is the option class

FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE. Is the best option and more benefif for learn in home, and more easy for the time or others problem and i cant wait what everthing stay good for my cass or classes .

B2D03F892B0D,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

In my position I think it's a great idea to attend classes from home only if you work, or if you can handle any type of work by yourself without a person that will persuade you to do the work, and if you know English perfect.

I think that some students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because for some students it's difficult to wake up early because some students who work on

Part-times, and some students don't want to wake up early, or they go to bed late for playing games on their phones.

Secondly. I think that some students might benefit from this program if they can handle any type of work independently without a teacher or any person persuading them to do the work, because some students are smart and they like to work independently, in silence, without people disturbing thems or without too much explanations.

Also. I think that the only students that can understand any work and can only attend classes from home, are those who knows English Perfect, because if you know English perfect then you can work in any topic or subject without the help of anybody, If you are a Hispanic born in other country then this program it can work for some Hispanic students because they are used to get everything easy, to get what they want without making a effort.

In the other hand, I think that this program it won't help to those students who distract easy or those who don't do work without any person who will persuade them to do the work, because there are students who likes everything easy, students who don't want to make an effort, this program it won't work to those students who don't like to study, to those who have only F on their classes or those who are skipping, or not going to school.

In conclusion I think this program can only help those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person. and for those students who have dreams, those who makes a effort to get what it can help thems in the future, for those that knows that life it's not easy, to those students that know that if you don't work for it you won't get what you want on life. those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person.",Male,12,Hispanic/Latino,395,455,443,13,8,55.375,51.08258998,29.23076923,133,455,Independent,Economically disadvantaged,Distance learning,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,train
B7075CD10BCC,"In my opinion the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a excellent idea for everybody. We have many benefit from to being able to attend classes from home for example, we have more time for sleep and have more energy for study, also the students has more dedication, the students has more concentration for study in home because, nobody distract to the student, the students have more time for make other things like work or others pastime

Many student don't like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I don't think so because we have help of all teachers. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they don't pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life.

Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you.

For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. Maybe

This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable. Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience.

In my conclusion I support and for me is a good idea the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because is a new experience and i like it the idea and is more comfortable stay in home is more peace, more concentration, is more time for study and more important is learned more things, new thing for the future because the place is not important you can study in others places but the important is study more and more. Study is more important, the place is not important beacuse when the person want to be someone like a professional in the future they need study much.",Male,12,Hispanic/Latino,447,478,474,10,6,79.0,40.59848485,29.49790795,141,478,Independent,Not economically disadvantaged,Distance learning,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,train
E6EF69520940,"Most of the times, the students don't get the help they need by the school. The reason for this is because some teachers don't really care about whether the students are learning or not, but about their money. Also, some students get bullied by other students and there is no one who could defend them. This happens in a many schools, such as schools in Mexico, United States, Central America, etc. So, in my opinion, attending classes at home is a great option for the students.

Classes online, well known as ""homeschooling"", is a method in which students can do the assignment of their classes at home in their computer. This idea emerged because there is many conflicts that school has to deal with, for example discrimination, and violence and between the students. So, thanks to the advances of technology, the school can provide their services at home. Is a great method, but not as going to the school, sit in your chair and learn. This method has its advantages, but also its disadvantages.

One of the advantages attending classes online is that is more comfortable and secure for the students. For example, the rate for shooting will be reduced, and the students will not suffer any discrimination against other students. Another reason are that it is less stressful because the students would more time to complete any work. Also, it helps the students to better subject. For example, students can watch videos about any specific subject, observe the procedures, and replay them if they are confused. Also parents can supervise their children and help them if they need, and they would not have to worry about attendances.

Classes online are a great benefit for students but they their disadvantages as well. For example there will be no jobs for teachers who really want to teach, share experiences to their students, and help them to improve in their lives. Another example is that students would not communicate with other students and would not know the importance of Team Work. Also, they would not have an experience by doing activities (such as playing sports, instruments, going to filmstrips, etc,)

which help them to develop useful skills. Another disadvantage is that schools would not have alternate classes that helps them to chose the career they want to. For example construction, cosmetics, arts, music, engineering, technology, etc.

In conclusion, attending classes online is a great method, but not as much as going to the school. The school is always going to be a learning center. If the school applies more fair rules, the students would feel more safety and gain a lot of confidence. Also, the school has to have better teachers who really want to help their students and not teachers that only care about their job. Anyways, the school helps us to get right path for our lives, so without it, we would not the education we need to improve in our lives and in the world.

3F1E511E2E1E,"Schools that provides distance learning as an option to attend classes from home online, or video conferencing are few of all the country. It is a good idea for all students that wants to graduate, even if they don't have time to go to school every day.

Students some times don't have time to go to school every day, some of them works in a part time jobs; That's difficult to them because, they need to wake up earlier to go to school and do homework in the afternoon.

Some students decided not go to school any more because, they need to work to pay bills, and help their families in home. Also, with this option students can be relaxing in their homes and studying at the same time. Another example why this is a good option for students is because some of them need classes to graduate, and they can not get that classes done by the school year, but if they have the possibility to take classes online they can finish during the year.

However, this beneficial option is good for those students that are not eligible anymore to attend school because of their ages. There is a final age that students can be accepted by the school, and if they had more than the age the school said, they can not attend to school anymore, even if they want to continue going to school and graduate. That's why online classes from home is great idea for those students who wants the diplomat.

In conclusion this option is beneficial for all students that want to study and do other jobs in the same time.

DA8F8C0D6952,"I believe that students attending school from home will benefit for many different reasons. Students who experience anxiety attacks, depression, bullying, or just not being able to attend school for the day will find great use in online school, they can connect with their classes or teachers without being in school and not have to miss out on important information or work. Students are able to be in a safe environment at home if they do not feel comfortable in school.

Furthermore, students with anxiety or depression may have a harder time going through out the school day then their peers. For example, my girlfriend who has very often panic attacks, dislikes attending her current school. She was a new transfer student to the school and was also new to the school itself. She found it hard to not have anybody to go to and vent during the school day which causes her to stress and have anxiety. Moreover, she gets very often panic attacks during the day which makes her not want to come to school more often. She finds it easier and safer to stay at home. When ever we're on the phone over face time, she's always doing her class work that she takes home to complete. She's a hardworking student and always does her work but because of the environment she's in, it limits her on what she is capable of.

Not only that it would help students feel secure, but for the students who are sick for the day and cannot attend school, wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. For example; there are days where I just feel weak and tired but I wouldn't want to miss a review day for a major test the next class. If there was online school, I would be able to connect with my teacher and the classes from home where I feel comfortable. Also, my mom wouldn't have to worry that i'm failing my classes because i'm not showing up to them. I believe that other students would agree with me on this argument because almost everyone I know, wishes they could attend school from home.

Moreover, adults might not have knowledge of this, but let me tell you; there is a lot of drama and rumors in every high school. No matter where it is, the policies it has, the advances of the students, there is drama. And drama is one major factor on why students wishes to attend school at home. Just Imagine the advances of our present civilization if there was no drama at school, and no have you heard this or have you heard that. Drama and rumors are big time distractions to daily school work and it peaks the interest of every student. By enabling online school, students dedicated to become scholars are able to take this distraction out of their equation. They can attend school without dealing with the big mouths talking up and down and all around the school.

Overall, distance learning has a very good impact on the students. Students feel safer at home, and when they are sick or cannot attend school for they day, they wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. Online school would be very beneficial for everyone.",Male,11,Asian/Pacific Islander,525,561,549,26,5,109.8,56.23997059,37.25490196,209,561,Independent,Not economically disadvantaged,Distance learning,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,train
52DC3B7C3952,"Working From Home

Should students be allowed to attend classes from home? I agree that attending classes while at home would be beneficial for many people and can actually help them work better. One reason is that it would be less stressful for the student and put a lot less pressure into getting the work done. Another reason is that it would give them more time to work, for example they could relax and take little breaks while working instead of having to cram all that work into one class session. My last reason is that it would help improve grades. If a student is allowed to work while being at home, it would allow their brain time to think more about their work and how they can improve it.

Attending classes from home would be less stressful and put a lot less pressure on the student. For example, one class session is an hour and thirty minutes. Teachers give a lot of work to students and expect them to get it done without any problem, but the problem is they can't because being forced to do a lot of work is not very fun and with very limited time can put a lot of stress on the teenage brain and also damage their mental health. Expectations now a days are really high for students but their mental health and state aren't taken into consideration.

Time is of the essence. Students need time to get their work done and whatever they aren't able to complete becomes homework. Having to do a lot of work without being able to take a break can really suck. Imagine if you had to do a bunch of work without being able to take a rest because whatever you don't complete you're gonna have to complete at home. If students could work from home, they'd have all the time they need to get their work done and they could take a break if they got too tired. At home students wouldn't have to worry about time because they could complete the work at their own pace.

Grades are important, and when a student gets a bad grade, it isn't exactly the best look. Working from home would allow students more time to think about their work, when in a classroom students can't spend a lot of time thinking because they don't have much time. On the other hand, being at home would give them all the time they could possibly need to complete their work and how they could improve it for a better grade. If students could improve their work they would get better grades, and there's no better place to do that then home, the place you're most comfortable with.

To sum it all up, students should be allowed to attend classes from home because it causes less stress and pressure which is better for their mental health, gives them more time to think and do their work, and helps improve their grades while in a place they're more comfortable with.",Male,11,Asian/Pacific Islander,550,522,508,21,6,84.66666667,57.06088457,31.99233716,167,522,Independent,Economically disadvantaged,Distance learning,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,train
