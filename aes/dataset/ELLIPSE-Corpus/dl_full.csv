"I think that students would benefit from learning at home,because they wont have to change and get up early in the morning to shower and do there hair. taking only classes helps them because at there house they'll be pay more attention. they will be comfortable at home.

The hardest part of school is getting ready. you wake up go brush your teeth and go to your closet and look at your cloths. after you think you picked a outfit u go look in the mirror and youll either not like it or you look and see a stain. Then you'll have to change. with the online classes you can wear anything and stay home and you wont need to stress about what to wear.

most students usually take showers before school. they either take it before they sleep or when they wake up. some students do both to smell good. that causes them do miss the bus and effects on there lesson time cause they come late to school. when u have online classes u wont need to miss lessons cause you can get everything set up and go take a shower and when u get out your ready to go.

when your home your comfortable and you pay attention. it gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. public schools are difficult even if you try. some teacher dont know how to teach it in then way that students understand it. that causes students to fail and they may repeat the class.

Some say students will not be benefit of attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because a lot of students don't have access to internet or they have no computers at home.

"They are some Schools offer for Students to Lerning as option for Students from home. They are many thinks you can't Lerning at home you can use by way of video or online.

First, Know in this world the technolgy availadle everywhere and you can use anytime you want to go online and attend the classes on the time.

Secand, They are many student they have a lot of job or they have baby's or anything, They can't go to schools to lerning. So, they should take classes by way of online or video they can open the classes on the job or at home.

Thrid, The student should behefit from deing and serios to do the work and homewark from home because this is nice from them they make it for you easy to learning evry thing on the time.

Last, If you want to learn or take any thing in this life you can do any time you want and anywhere, You can take many classes at home, and finsh you'r education. The Schools are the Bast houes in the world.",2.0
"Students can benefit from this option, but also can affect them in different ways. Many students have difficulty coming to school every single day. One impediment may be transportation, a lot of them do not know how to drive, so they can not drive to school. Some students live in areas where the buses can't enter. Many of them walk to get to school every day or ride a bicycle. They face many problems but the biggest one is weather. The climate can change quickly, when is raining a lot or is cold these students stay at home, because there is no way how they can get to school.

Students can benefit by not attending everyday to school. For students who live far away from school is a great option, because they safe time and also they can work during the day. As we see many students have a job after school, and this is hard for them because they have to be active in school. There is a big problem because they come tired to school, and you see them sleeping in classes. They can not be concentrate because they do not have time to sleep. Many of them do not have time to do homework, or different projects they have to complete.

It is a great option to have schools that offers distance learning. This action help many students but also can affect them. In my opinion when you attended to school everyday you can learn more. Because you have all the resources you need to understand, and complete the assignments. But students who like to work hard and take their time to studying in their houses, it can also be easy for them.

Before that there was not technology is was extremely hard. Now that the science had grown up, and the technology appear, we have a way more opportunity to do many things. One opportunity is to studying online from our houses. As I said now that we have technology, we have more opportunities and is really easy to find stuff that you need to learn in your school.

In my conclusion, I think is good for our society having those school who offers distance learning. Because many students can not be in school everyday, and this action help them to keep studying. If this program does not exist many of them could never go again to school, because of all the impediments they have to attend school, and they will never accomplish their dreams. ",4.0
"The new generation of students decide to take their classes in online. Although if the students take classes in online they might allow to finish high school in a short time,also they might be safe at home, they can take more free time to work or enjoy with their family, and graduate as soon as possible and start the college.

Even thought some people might say students shouldn't take classes in online because they can not learn good enough, they might be distracted or even ask any question to solve their problem, regular high school have different program to help students to be successful on their grades. In this case students need to talk with any consular or teacher in school to give some advantage and disadvantage about online class, student might need to know their benefits on what they going to do for their own good. Most people care about education, students need put some interest.

concluding with this state argument student should take any classes in online because they don't put much interest to learn any assignment, students might need to attendance to a regular high school to learn and have better apprenticeship, and abilities for their accomplishment, students in high school are more successful, they have good opportunities to get in the best colleges. Nowadays teenagers are more focus in having fun, some of them do not know that education is very important, if we want to have a good job and better future, every child need education first, but students are following good rulers.

according to this argument I have this experience my brother want to take his classes in online because he does not want to come to the school, i still in a normal high school almost at the end of the first quarter and my brother still waiting a call for his classes. He said it was his best choice but in my opinion that was not a good idea because if come to the school i learn and understand my classes, when a teacher is explaining and helping me to do my problem i feel more exciting about it. I want to be a great student and learn everything instead of be at home waiting for an acceptation for classes.

concluding with my argument students would not benefit to attend classes in online, attending to the school is more important and benefit, they take serious their resposabilities in everything,they became more measure,classes in online never going to be same as the regular school, students never are going to learn very well, teeneger really need to attendance the school for a better education.

"Distance learning can be very helpful to students who cannot attend classes at school like other students. Although distance learning can effect students losing focuses in their classes, nevertheless, learning away from school can help us the students to have less stress, and giving us an opportunity to take care of our brothers and sisters and attending classes without skipping classes.

Almost everyone in school is stressing about something,so attending classes online would help a lot. For example: It gives us more time to finish our work for other class and stress less, because to me having the advantage to attend online classes would help out a lot, and also i might have other classes to worry about. so having an option for us the students to attend class from home by using online or video conferencing might not sound the worst. And could help students who are suffering from anxiety and having any type of stress. By using online classes they could listen to music to clam themselves down and not having any signs of a panic attack, because in school not every class or teachers might let the students use their phone to listen to music; they might not be able to know if the student is having a panic attack, but at home if they are attending classes online and having a panic attack their parents would be there to help them clam down.

Most students need to stay home in order to help with family emergence. Research has show that almost 50% of the time if the student is not at school, then they are at home helping out with their siblings at home, doing that they skipping school and losing an education, but with online classes they can do both without skipping class or missing anything in school. Because with online class the information they need would be provided to them, if they have a laptop or computer and in case they do not have any of these technology they can just go to their local Library with their siblings and do their assessments with no worries, because their siblings would find some kind of fun to do at the library.

In conclusion attending classes online at home would benefit a lot for us the students because in case some thing happens at home they just go online at do their work without stress about losing points, to me personal attending classes online would be very helpful because I would have to stress a lot, can skip school and get some sleep.

"Should students have the option to take online classes? Yes, I believe that students should have the opinion to take those online classes and that no one should take those classes away from those students. Students can be more active when they are at home then at school. You can pick a time to start your online classes and have a fixed schedule. It is important for students to have the education of there own way instead of worrying about how public/private schools are run.

Most students attend to focus more when they are taking online classes; For an example, Students dont have to worry about how teachers are teaching students when they are in a class full of other students. Students tend to struggle when teachers aren't teaching their students properly and care more about there monthly payments. Second example, is that having that one-on-one connection. Having that bond with your teachers are great ways to not be afraid to ask question when you dont get a problem or how to get the answers to the homework. Third example, most students tend to be antisocial at school because thats how they were born or even scared that people around them with judge the student and that the students wanna feel safe at school.

My second argument is that students tend to get bullied at school; Bullying is a huge thing around the world and that bullying is a serious problem; Bullying is the number one cause of student not attending to school and not getting the proper education they need: For an example, when the student is taking an online class, they dont have to worry about other students picking on him, but instead he can feel safe and really enjoy the education that he is learning online at home. There was this one time that one of my really close friends was being made fun of and picking on him everyday at school. He would sometimes not attend to school because he was too scared to come in to class and would always worry about the other students. He would not focus on his school work, but would mostly focus about protecting himself.

My Third argument is that students can ask question when they are having that one-on-one with the teacher. Students are afraid to ask a not so good questions in math, English, history, etc. Students have that nerve racking moment when a teacher tells the class if they have any questions. There was this one time that a teacher asked the class if there were any questions and none of the students raised their hands because I felt like everyone knew what they were doing in the class but me. I was having that moment that I didn't wanna waste the other students time about my question that I didn't understand on. It was the judgment that they would give me, but I know that it wasn't the case, people tend to over think about the problem inside the classrooms. For an example, Extroverts tend to not talk/socialized to people often, instead they don't talk to others and the problem that they are having trouble with and scared to ask the teacher because they feel insecure about talking or feel uncomfortable talking to others.

In conclusion, Students should have the option to take an online class and enjoy learning like everyone else should. Learning is a fun thing to do, but have different learning styles in life. The world keeps changing everyday now and new technology is developing overtime.",3.5
"No,I dont think students should attend online classes from home. Because online classes might be sometimes harder for them to understand and to get help. It is always better to take classes in the person so students can learn better and get more experience and they can easily get help from the teachers whenever they want to. Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes. And it help students to be on time always.

Students should take the classes in person so they can attend school daily and get more active. It is totally different experience by taking classes online or in person beacuse sometimes its hard to understand from the online classes and students cant get it. Online classes are good for the students who need to graduate early and they cant have more in person classes so they can take the classes online and graduate on time. online classes make students lazy and dont they dont do it on time and they get lazy by staying at home. Online classes might be harder sometimes than the in person classes. Some people are used to online classes because they feel they are more easier for them. online classes are good for students who want to complete their all the required credits. Some people dont get time to do the online classes beacuse they have to go to work and they cant able to finish everything on time. They put more effort by going to school and sometimes they just dont feel like doing to online class. Online classes are good for those who wants to complete there courses early. Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon. They should try there best to attened school beacuse it is more better than doing the online classes.

Online classes make some people lazy and they dont get experience of going to school. They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more. Some people just want to take the classes online becasue they dont have the time to go to school.

Some students attend both online and in person classes beacuse they cant get enough classes at school in a year and they want to graduate on time so they take online classes so they can finish everything on time. It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time. Some students are always late on doing on online classes because they dont have enought time to do it If students get to in schools they get to know more about school and be more responsibility and they can get more education so they dont feel difficulty when they go to college they should always have experience of high school so they dont have any problem in college later on. And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer.

In conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable. But in my opinion i would rather take in school classes because it would help me in future by getting good experience of highschool and learn more",4.0

"I think that the online or video coferencing wounld not benefit high school student because they many pros and con. pros student can work on thier own sudent can work on home cons

Not all student have a acces to the internet student cannot understand the assessment it make it not English speaker to understand student cannot benefit for attend classes from house. because take classes from home cannot improve the student educated. In the school class student are alllow to work with group and work with teacher. home school can cause distraction, worries. For Example when you're work or take exam and your family member call you to do something for her. in school they taught you many thing to learn. Online classes and school classes have similarity and different thing in common

The First different between this two classes is that online classes are classes that you take home why school classes are classes that you take in school.

The second different between this two classes is that in online class you don't learn lots of thing. but in school classes you learn of thing. This are the similarity between two classes.

"How do you make friends along your life?

well, some friendships are made by internet, outside activities, and others by being neighbors for a long time, however, the most lasting and common friendships are the ones you made at school. Therefore, you spend hours, days, months, and years being socially with the people around you, but what if you don't want to attend to school, and decide to take classes from home?

At school, you don't only made friends and memories , you also earn and learn good advices, and you see different perspectives.

People who are not socialist tend to be ones who graduated by taking online classes; they don't know how to interact with people, because they had spent most of their life talking and interacting with their computers. Sometimes we are the cause why people rather to take online classes, we separate them by diseases, illness and mental problems, not a lot of students at school have the chance to receive help or talk with their counselor ; this is one of the reasons why people doesn't want to attend to school, and choose online classes.

A lot of cases now days about why people decide to course home school are:

Pregnancy at early age: The girls who get pregnant while they are in High School either take home school or don't go study anymore, when their belly starts growing they feel ashamed, and they tend to quit school.

The Life of Generic_Name, a 17 years old High School student , who migrate 2 years ago from Guatemala. Generic_Name's teacher was talking about the online courses, home school and other online options, in order that Generic_Name can graduate on time, she was so excited about her graduation date. She had a problem if for some reasons she decided to take the online course to finish High School on time; she couldn't speak English. So, how could Generic_Name learn to speak English, sitting all day long in front of her computer?

This is an example of a problem that many students had to face, when they are forced to do home school.

In conclusion, students won't benefit by attending classes from home, here is one the reasons why ; I am a student and sometimes I don't do the work that my teachers assign me, knowing so well, my teacher can walk where I am sitting and ask me for the assign work. So, can you imagine the online courses, students can search their answers, be on their phones, or taking care of someone while they are taking the online class, so much distraction. ",3.5
"Imagine if online schooling was offered at every school. Schools are offering online classes for students to attend class. Also schools offer video conferencing online to help benefit at home. This is important because some students are not responsible to get to school on time. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because health issues play a major role through out the school year, students can become smarter by taking time to learn the content, students would not have to stress over transportation.

Certainly some might think staying in the house all day causes bordom to do school work. Others believe students tend to need help from an adult to understand that content. Still others argue by feeling alone will not motivate them to be productive.

To begin with, health issues play a major role through out the school year on students. Students always tend to come to school while they are sick. So that spead germs through out the school and causes major illness. Spreading germs can have someone hospitalized and in bad condition. Which can make students have bad attendince. Also parents would loose jobs to attend to their sick child. However staying home and still be able to do your school work causes less stress. Because it gives student more time to be able to complete there assignments. Another reason way online classes will help out students that are in wheel chairs, crutches, and broken legs. Is they dont have to be rushed, pushed, in the crowded halls. Therefore they feel more safe and have enough space at home. Parents will be able to supervise their child more. An not be worried that something else might happen. Health issues should be a cause of not being able to not attend school if you are able to do it from home.

Secondly students become smarter doing the research on their own to retain the information. Every student have a diffent way to learn. Some students need day's to understand the content. An some can understand the content off the first try. Also some student need to see it hands on then be supervised as they complete the task. Witch is also not a bad way to retain information. If help is needed the video conferencing will help out in the long run. Being able to home relax and still manage to completed your school work motivates the student to remain on task. Another reason why is grades will have a major increase and students would maintain a higher grade point average. The best part of the video conferencing is the student will be able to replay it if needed. Instead of hearig it once in class from a teacher then forgetting the information the next time you have that subject. Apart of life that is important to have is knowledge, so being able to teach and perfect your weakness are important.

Lastly transportation is a mojor problem for students. Some students have to walk, get droped off, or take the bus to get to school on time. Most students are not responsible to wake up on time to catch the bus. The students that walk are stessed, because they have to walk while its raining, hot, ride their bike, cold, and dark. In conditions like that are not safe for students to go through is something happend to them. Most of the time parents have to work and be worried that their child get to school safe. Having the privaledge to be home and do work will prevent fights, childish students, and angery teachers. So everyone would have peace and respect for one another and learn more. There will be no disagreement and aultications with students and teachers. After school students will not have to rely on transperations, because they are already home. Less stress can be taken off of adukts that are nor responsible for you. Having to find transpertation to your destination is worth money and not everyone is forchen to loan out money all the time.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because health issues play a major role through out the school year, students can become smarter by taking time to learn the content, and students would not have to stress over transportation. If students was able to stay home and do school work the it would be less confusion in school. Keep calm and remain focus even if times get hard on your shoulders.        ",3.5
"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. Schools offer this so that students who are troubled or don't like coming to school can still have a right to to learn and it also helps students who are very sickly to have access to all their classes and homework that they missed when their not at school.

Some students can not focus in class because they are easily distracted by other students and by these distractions they end up getting bad grades and it causes them to lose hope in school and even what they want to become in life. they could also have something happening outside of school that could affect them to not want to be in school anymore and they can also get bullied by other students which would make them stop coming to school and some kids are just better off staying a home and doing classes at home.

These online and distance learning classes can help students get back on track with school and catch up with their work that they missed. The students who want to be home schooled can wake up at anytime that they choose and do the work that is planned for them and the ones that don't like coming to school or the ones that get bullied can stay at home and get their work done without missing class and getting bad grades because of them not being their to do classwork or take test and quizzes. The students who are taking these classes can benefit from these a lot.

These programs can help students be able to their work on their own time and a have teacher who can teach them but online like at school and this can help students become independent in being able to do their work and help them stay away from trouble that they could be having at school and give them confidence to be able to do their work. I think this can benefit students because they are in the comfort of their homes and its like a regular class but it just online and you could get all your work done and by that you earn good grades.

If students who don't like coming to school,sickly and get bullied,always miss class and get bad grades because their are not their to take tests or quizzes then these online and distance class can benefit them to do work at the comfort of their home. It will also persuade them to not give up on school and give them a right to get their education before they throw it away. These online classes and distance classes can help teach these students as if they were in school and if they work hard enough they can get good grades. These are all reasons why these programs can benefit student.",3.0
"One topic that is frequently debated today is schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would be benefit to student or not. Some people believe school should offer this program for students that need time for their morning routine. They feel that it would help students for do not need to have to wake up early and go to school. I believe distance learning program that school offer for students would not be benefit to students because students will not have a skill to communicate with other people, it will make students have less enthusiasm, and some students family did not have no internet or device to watch the video online teaching.

One reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because it would make student get less skill from communicate with other people. When students go to school they will meet friends have a communication with each other or talk to their teacher. Communication is an important for every type of jobs. Communication is one of the most important thing that should have inside the lesson because every job or every company will hiring people that have good skill to communication with other people. Communication is almost every where inside the school but if school have to consent to have the distance learning program, it will affect to student to get a job by taking students away from their communication with other people.

Another reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because it will make students have less enthusiasm to learn. Every morning students have to wake up early and get ready for school is one of the practice thing that will let student get ready for outside the world. Enthusiasm is one of the most thing that will help students to have more responsibility to their job or their self. Lack of the enthusiasm will make students have a lack of responsibility to their job or their self. However, if school consent the distance program it will make student get a lack of the enthusiasm and it will make students get lack of the responsibly to take care even them self.

Final reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because some students did not have device or Internet at home to watch the online or video conferencing. There are many family that did not have the Internet at home and they will not be able to attend the classes at home and will not be able to watch the online or video conferencing. It will not be fair to the outer family that do not have a internet or device to get into the online or video conference to the family that have the internet or device to use. Therefore, school should not consent the distance learning program to make all the students equally.

As you have read, I believe distance learning program that school offer to students would not be benefit to students and affect to students by take students to the bad position. School is the learning place for students to get a knowledge. If we are going to have only the online teaching, school will not exist. Only when we value the learning in class, communicating with friends, and being equal with other we will feel that school is a good place for studying and getting the knowledge. On that day the world will better to have school full with students that have a good knowledge and ready for out world.",3.0
"Have you experience taking online classes from home?

students who plans to take online classes from home they would have to learn to be more responsible and dedicated. Could students benefit by taking online classes from home,

Yes I think it would be fantastic idea taking classes from home, it would be a great way to learn without having to leave your house or worrying you wont get to school on time. Home school can get you more prepare by learning and working on time managment,by woking on time managment prepares you for future jobs. For example I have friend that does home schooling she tried going to a regular school but didnt feel comfortable her parents decided to try home schooling, she ended up loving it,she had more time do other activities, its a great idea because you could prevent bullying from happening.

Imagen not having to leaving youre home, students would have more energy because they wouldn't be as exausted. Cerain students have walk miles not matter the bad weather. If students take online classes they could get more sleep and finish there work faster. students would be able to concentrate. In school you get distracted a lot because you have friends next to you trying to talk or make caos also interupting the class.

Not having energy for school is a big factor specially for student who work and walk to school in the mornings.

if student dont have the enery to go to school learn they would not be able to get good grades. a clear example is myself having to wake up every morning at seven am and walking thirty min to school and also working every day is exausting not matter the weather. Its really hard trying to stay awake in the mornings after walking a certain distance. Thats why i would prefer online studying as well it would change my life completely and i would feel more ready to do work.

in conclusion online classes is a great way to study if you dont feel comfortable going to school.

I would take online clases its less tiring its a great rest having the time to do my work from home and expirience a new way to study.",3.0
"Should be students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

Well,I think students can be benefit this program,if they can work at home by the way of online or video conferencing,because students have more opotuniry to study like have more time to work,they don't need to walk or take a bus to come school,can be more effect to students,students can feel better when they try to stury because in his home there is not people talking a lot abuot things,but people talking not about the class.

Also student can choose the time to they can star the classes,because some students have to work in a job,so when is cold outside and students they don't like to come school,they can wort at home by the way of online or video conferencing,students can be more responseble or maybe not is depent what class of student are you,but the things is there is a lot reasons of benefit for stundents can have that classes.

Some students feel good working at home,there is not streess for them,they can take a break,they can eat and his work. They spend more the energy of his mind etc...

I think the best option for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video coferencing to learn. But also is depent waht classes student do you are,because some student are lazy when they work at home.

Also parent can check his work in look if they do his work good or bad,take classes online is one think like because for me is more aesy to do my homework,so inconclution students have benefit from being able to attend classes from home. ",2.0
"Benefits of attending public schools

Imagine a child or student taking classes at home. How would his or her parents feel?

Would home school be helpful for their child? Is homeschooling important for thier child than public schools? Students would benefit to attend classes in school rather than attending class at home because students can become active, getting enough information, and having the ability to share ideas.

Attending public schools can persuade students to become active. Teachers can also persuade students to become active as well. Teachers wants students to have fun. For an example, physical education, or for short PE. It is a program in school for children to have exercise and training. Teachers would allow students to play inside or outside. Even if students do not want to participate.

Not only schools let students become active in class, but also offers information to students who need help. Getting information can help students to become better at understanding things that students learned in school. It is important to know why students want to learn. For an example, students staying after school for help. Staying after school can help students study for a test. If a student needs help or needs more information, do not be afraid to ask for help. A teacher will be there to help you. Teachers can give their best to answer student's questions.

Not only schools can persuade students to become active and offers information to students, but also shares ideas. Sharing ideas can help students as well. Students can share their ideas other students. For an example, completing assignments in a group. Students love being with partners or group to solve problems. Students would listen to others student's opinion or debate and see if they agree or disagree. It is always helpful to be with a group and not be alone by yourself.

In public schools, students can become active, can get information that they need, and let students share their ideas. That is why it is important for children to go to school. Home schools are different than public schools. Home schools can be very challenging for some students. A student working alone with no partner, not being active, and not getting enough information from parents. Imagine a student being in that position. How would she or he feel? Public schools would be the best option for children. Imagine if every student went to school, their would be a positive change in their future. School can build student's knowledge everyday and to do it is by learning. ",4.0
"I agree with student taking online classes. Because some student might be to old for then to attend school or do a fulltime school program. By doing online classes. Student will be not worring about attend school on time, if they get sick or have to travel for a emergency happen. They would have the chance of talking with their counselor and talk about sign up for online school. If the teacher give them homework they would have the chance of sending by email.

In other way been able to take classes online, give the student a chance of choosing their own schedule for example, some student might to take classes in the moprning, some student might want to take classes afternoon or at night time. Taking classes online give the student a chance of doing classes in the other side of the country or anywhere. Many student are not able to attend school.

Attending online school give the student the advantage of working or doing their own projects at home for example student won't relay on school supplies. Students by taking classes online benefits then, because some student have two jobsor lives to far, and they are to old for attending school.

For the students that have two jobs. They get the chance to use there work break to take some classes, test, or even quizzes. For example in my side of the story if my school would give online i would be able to have to jobs and support my family paying some bills. For other student have the same problem.

In my conclusion taking classes online benefits the student in many different ways. for example by choosing their opwn schedule, by given then the opportunity of doing their own things, by giving then a aesier way to learn, by showing then that they are adults now and demostrating and teaching to do take the right choose.

"One topic that is frequently debated today is whether students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Some people taking classes from home is more helpful. They feel like they have more time to do extra activities throughout the day. I believe that going to school is better because you get to experience real world, you get make friends, and you get to enjoy all the school activities.

First reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to experience the real world. When you go to school you have to wake up early to get ready and make it on time to school, in the other hand when you are home schooled you get to wake up at whatever time and still do your work, that is not experiencing the real world because life it is not always going to be like that. School makes you experience the real world by so many ways. When you are at school you work in groups with other people and that is getting you ready for when you grow up and have to work with other people at your job.

Second reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to make friends. When going to school you get to interact with people and make new friends, in the other hand when you are at home you do not interact with anyone it is only you by yourself. Having friends is really good, they can help with what they can. At school you can ask your friends for help in a subject when you do not understand something.

Third reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to enjoy all the school activities. School activities are one of the favorite things about school that students like. If you are home schooled you do not get to enjoy them and have fun with your friends. When going to school you get to enjoy senior night, school dances, and extra curricular activies, which are super fun.

As you have read, I believe that going to school is better than taking your classes from home because you get to experience real world, you get make friends, and you get to enjoy all the school activities. School teaches you most of the things that you know and need in life at the end of the day. On that day we are going to realize on why we need school so much.                           ",3.5
"Attending classes from home is not a good idea. I think it's better to attend classes at school for many reasons that I have experienced at home. It's not fun becuase you don't have any teacher to explain to you what you don't understand (well you will have a teacher but he or she wont be there personally), you won't get any help from no one if your taking the online course. Also student will not benefit it because they will be off track and instead of doing there work or what they are suppose to be doing, they will be wondering around by the internet. I defenitly do not agree that the student will benefit attending classes at home.

Having a tecaher with you in class is wonderful. There will be a point when you will have so many questions about the topic that you were discussing with the class. When your in class at school you will learn so much from teachers by giving out examples that are being giving out to the class and explaining it to you. But if your taking an online course It's defenitly more difficult for you to understand the main idea of the lesson. We won't have a teacher right next to us. We have to work indepentdently with out a friends help. It's not similar to when your in class and you ask a friend for help, they will love to help you out. Online class you won't have a friend helping you out. We have to take so many notes in order to understand the objective of the lesson. I personally had so much trouble with the online class, I had to take about 3-5 lessons each day, I had to write down notes for each lesson, I had to take at least five quizzes each day. I had to re-read the lesson like threes time in order to understand and capture the important facts. Honestly you learn how to be more organize and independent each day. I personally consider students to attend classes at school. It's not a good idea doing online class and taking so many notes.

In class, tecahers are strict when student have there electonic out whil there tecaheing or when student are working on class work. At home and doing your class work and at the same time being on your phone, your not paying fully interest on your class, Since you home, don't have a teacher, you feel like you have the right to be on your phone and laptop and do what ever you want, and not doing you work. That shouldn't be the case if you stay home and take the online class, It's because to there was a purpose. If we don't pay attention to what we are doing, and we are paying more attention to our phones we will never learn anything abiut the course. That could cause use to fail the class. Than, we got to re-teake the class.

In my opinion I will also agree to some student that wants to take the online class because you can wake up late, taking you time to eat breakfast. It's not like going to school having to get up so early, not having the time to eat, and having to chase the school bus. I'm that type of person that loves to sleep. But it's our responsibilty to do our work and tun it on time before the deadline. If you dont want to fail the class you have to save some time for your class than, you have to save some time for your self and for school work. Not all the time it will be about you. There needs to be some time for something else more important.

In conclusion, I think Student will not benefit from able to attend classes at home. It's a lot of responsibility to remind your self that have to attend class at home, do all your work and turn it in on time. We wont have a teacher with us (personally), we have to do all our work independently. That's why I think it's not a good idea for students to attend classes at home.                                      ",3.5
"There students that would be able to benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because there schools that can let you take online classes. You are able to work on your own pace,you are also able to balance school,work and spending time with friends and families,and your able to take video conferencing at home.

There are many different schools that can let you take online classes. There students going through family issues at home that they aren't able to attend school regularly. It can help them to learn in class so they don't fall behind or fail the grade. They just want to learn like us and have a great future. It can also help if you are attending collage but not want to stay on campus.

When having the benefit to take online class at home is working at your own pace. You are working at your own pace to get in done fast or you just like to take your time. Many students prefer taking their time becasue it will help them understand it more then rushing the working knowing that it could be wrong. It can also help them be more then the other colleagues at school. When having this opportunity your able to get work done without any distractions.

When balacing school,working and spending time with family and friends can be very diffcult at times if you are attending school regularly but when taking online classes it can help you understand the class more and you can focus more then getting distracted at school because of friends. This will help you get the work done in matter of seconds.

When having the intrenet your able to do may things but having the opportunity to a video conference from home while still attending school is the best. This will help you with one on one tutoring sessions to ask questions to your teacher or professor when having trouble with anything in a subject. You are also able to learn new things while doing video conference.

Students should take this opportunity to attend school from home because instead of going to school for seven to eight hours, you can learn everything at home without anyone rushing you or having a deadline when its due. Its better to take your time and take the opportunity. I would recommed this to anyone who would rather get to learn at home on their own.",3.0
"Students will not be benefited if they attend classes from home by online or video conferencing because then they will not concentrate much on studies and will take studies lightly. Students could be benefited if they attend classes by coming to school so that they can be attentive in class and will be able to clear their doubts.

Students will not be benefited if they attend classes from home by online or video conferencing because then they will not concentrate much on studies and which will lead to bad grades. They will not be having test and quizzes often. They might become lazy and start copying each other work. If they do not attend school, then there will be less chances of students doing work sincerely at home. They will not be able to get proper education at home and there will be less communication with students and teachers. If there will be less communication then they will not be able to get more open with others. There will be no group work so that students can share their ideas regarding studies. They might start taking breaks often. There will be no routine for students for studying at home. They will not be able to concentrate much working at home due to lot of distractions like T.V, movies, videos games, text ting etc. If you will not get a better education you might not be able to sussed in life. The more you have the education then there are more chances of getting a bright future. The proper education you can get is by going to school. If you will attend school, then you can correct your mistakes and learn from them. If you will stay at home you won't know what are you doing correct and what you are doing wrong.

How much you learn and read more the better because learning and reading takes you around the world. Teachers should also watch every student more carefully because if a student is doing something wrong then teachers can help them and make sure they go in the correct way. Parents should also keep an eye on their student that how they are doing because if they are not then parents can also guide them.

So, I conclude by saying that it is better for every student to get education at school instead of getting at home.",3.5
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home ?

Well school is a place your suppose to feel comfortable in, there are many different schools. I personally think being home schooled can have it's advantages and disadvantage, you of course have benefits for example not being bothered by other classmates, and finishing your work on time without having a distraction, kids in outiside schools have that disadvantage of having classmates who don't care about there education and some kids get carried away and distracted and they end up having to repeat classes or stay another extra year, It's very different because years on years you can just retake the class at home with nobody judging you about failing, here it is like an embarassment to be seen another year so that's something to look into.

Home schooled kids i would say get more attention as in that one on one attention, I would also say outside schools get the same but there are plenty of full classes and the teacher can't always get around to all students. There are lots of kids who want to be able to attend outside school but they can't for many reasons for example a disability or how they are a celebrity, being in that situation you would want to not be known like that so your just forced and obligated to attend home school and that's when home school kids would think it would be better to be attending outside school you'll always be home and feel trapped you'll get tired of being in your own home, It does people good being able to socialize a bit.

School can also be finished faster during home school, lots of things are offered, but also lots of things are not offered for example lunch, in almost all public schools there is free lunch, free everything your getting a free education, home school is expensive and you will always provide your own food. The wifi at home will also be payed, the computer and just many things but as we know it can be beneficial in life your getting an education so it's worth the spend you'll get something out of it.

What's better than being home and getting an eduacation it's benefitting you and it will in the future, when you get a dipoma. My point is either your in public school, private school, home school, it will benefit you in many many ways. ",3.5
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students would benefit themselfs by taking classes at home. Because they would be more focus with out anyother classmates around they would also focus more if they had a quite place to study or just do there work and students would have more time to do there work or get things done.

students would focus better if they did not have a other classmate talking to them. Some students can not foucs if someone else is talking it might bother them it also might bother them if other classmates are making loud noises. For example i am one of those students that when i am taking a test i can not concentrate if other students are talking.

students would have more time to study and finsh work because. They would be able to take breakes during each class. students can ask there teachers to help them study for a test or quiz they can also ask a friend to help them too. students can take a break between clases and do work for other clases.

students would focus more if they had a quite place to study like the libary or somewhere they might know that would not have much noise or taking involved. students would focus better and concentrate better they will also get there work done on time.

Inconclusion this is why schools should offer distance learnig for students because students would benefit themselfs to work alone with out any taking or classmates making noise.         ",3.0
"Although some say schools should not offer classes online because when students are out of school someone else could be doing the work for them and they will not be learning anything, actually schools should offer classes online because most of the students who go to schools have to work and they drop out of school to work and taking classes online would help them be educated at the same time they're working.

Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school it's hard. They are falling asleep in class and they don't want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime.

Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and that's what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldn't happen.

In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they don't have to wake up early every morning.

In conclusion,schools should provide classes online because colleges,universities also provide them and most of the people who have taken them have been successful from their classes. That is the best thing schools could do for the students.",4.0
"I currently don't really like doing school online. The main reason i don't like schools online is because i used to do it myself. I didn't really learn form doing school online. One of the main reasons why i was doing school online was because my parents didn't like public schools. So for that being said other student might like it but me personally i don't.

School online may help others then going to actual school. Maybe the person is going through something in school. Doing school at home my be easier for some students,

they probably learn quicker and probably finish school faster. Others may not work that way, some maybe work slower in school, so they wanna work at their own paste . Others may just wanna tryout school at home.

On the other note it's good for schools to do that. If some students were going on a trip they could easily do school on the road. I would help them stay on track with the class. or maybe the student did something bad in school that it would lead them to do school at home. Oh and if a student gets sick to the point to where he can't come to school ,and it was something bad they would do school at home.

To be completely honest i don't like this idea at all. It's because i did it for a good old 3 years, and it was a bad experience for me. I wouldn't remand it, but if you where going through somethings then yeah go for it. I like public school better then doing school online because i like to ask questions and see it myself in person.

"As a student, I can say there are a lot benefits for a student from being able to attend classes from home, is really convenience for a student that some schools offer distance learning as an option, every school should have that opportunity; it ca be helpful for a lot of students, is good for students that does not have a lot of time, so that help them to have a flexible manage of time, in some cases the student are more successful by taking the classes online.

For example if some students have to work , and because their work's schedule take them a lot of time or they have to work at night, they do not feel like waking up earlier in the morning, sometimes they start to getting late to classes, missing classes or missing all days of school, but if the student try to taking classes online can be really helpful for them; since they can have their schedule at their convenient, the opportunity or the facility of making up their on schedule according to their others activities.

Also when someone have to travel a lot for some reason, taking the classes online they do not have stay in the same place every time they are taking the classes, it dose not matter, they can take it anywhere they want, the only two things they need is a computer, and also to have internet connection, and thats it, they should be good with those two things or some people do not have that facility of moving of one place to other, they do not have the money to defray cost for the transportation, or is just to far away from their houses, so the classes online are a way to fix that problem.

There is a large percentage that the students that are taking or took classes online are or were going great, their are doing a successful work, they are being tempting to show more attention to their classes, a lot people say that they feel the classes easier, and also that is easier to study,

when the classes have videos they can put back the video over and over, when ever they want, how many times they want, where ever they want,if they want the teacher to do not talk fast or to do it they can regulate that also, they save a lot of money, because they do not have to spend a lot of money in materials, like for posters and things like that, they do not have to be with some people that distract them from the classes and is also faster to get the classes done.

So how is showed the opportunity that some schools bring them is wonderful, it have a lot of benefits for us, like some students are more successful taking the classes online, so much students are interested in the classes online, feel like is better for them so that way they can be taking classes and doing other things, they just have learn how to manage their time; people that work can do their classes at morning and go work at night, they can have a flexible schedule.",3.5
"Some student can learn to attend classes from home. And I think it's a great way to learn if you want some good grades. If I wanted to learned; I would stayed at school or watch a video to how to English, biology, or what classes do I chose from. But online or video conferencing are very different. online can be probably a website, YouTube, (Example like be able watch how to do math) or other. video conferencing is probably like a chat room or some video live.

Online is a great way to learn because I use on homework, essay, Google, YouTube, and other website. And here an of example. If I wanted how make a cake and when I used online website. It bring the website how to bake a cake. And there simple as that. But sometime if I ever get like a hard assignment and I checked it online, and it gave me the wrong answer, then sometimes the website can't be everything right. But I go ahead and tried other website to see if there a correct answered.

Now let say that I had to studied a lion. I can go online to checked in Google and it bring me to whole bunch of website, and click one of those website to see if there a way to studied some lion or go to YubeTube to watch how scientist studied theses creatures.

Video conference is probably like talking to a teacher or maybe live chat. And the way I think of the video conferencing is not to bad. It like you're teacher or someone is teaching you, and its like simpler to school. If I wanted to do it, like if there a problem that I need to fix then I go to video conference so they can helped me and the question. But I think its a great idea to do it.

The way I see is online is a helpful and video conference is helpful too. But I think it like home school staying at home and studied online or video conference. So my reasons is it a way to learned fast, getting good grades, or other information that you need for the future. And here a other reason why to use online or video conference. Online is been update like a few times. For example lets say Google doc. Google doc has been one the greatest website that I ever used. In that website, you can do almost everything like book project, essay, making slide shows and other helpful tools. But video conference is pretty helpful too. And my example is like if I need help I can contact my fellow people to help me.

Finally the best way to learned is sometimes online for helpful website and video conference to contact if teacher or other can help me. But I likely used online because it pretty helpful because let say I forgot a textbook and my homework is due the next day. Well I can go online and check my answer if i got it right. And I sometime I always used online to see if how to bake a cake or other information that I need.",3.5
"In my opinion i think online schooling wont benefit any student because, you dont have a teacher in front of you explaining what to do. Video conferencing is something different, you basically at school but on a screen. Youll be able to hear the teacher while shes explaining the assignment and teach it to you better so that way you understand more and you can be able to ask questions. Looking at a screen and reading an assignment isnt going to help you much. If you have an actual teacher, she/he goes into details and shows you examples of how to do an assignment. Being home schooled is pretty challenging. Most online schooled kids tend to procrastinate and end up falling behind. Most shy kids are home schooled or video conferencing because of problems or any other thing thats going on with them. If students want to attend online and video conferencing, then thats fine as long as their getting their education and finishing their assignments. Its the law for every student to go to school or to do something thats related to school. Online classes are pretty expensive to pay up, so students must complete their assignments because theyll charge you for it either way. I think attending school would be better. Teachers teach you better and help you out when you dont understand something. You get less homework and maybe even easier homework to do. You dont need to pay anything for your child to go to a public school. Your student gets taught well. So in that case i think going to school is better then online class and video conferencing. ",3.5
"Benefits of being home school.

Have you ever felt like you could not handle school?, well let me tell you that you have options, in here you are going to know the benefits of being home school. When I was younger school was a challenge for me; There was always conflicts at school and the environment was really a distraction, not good for me. Attending to school from hone have a lot of benefits. Students are going to be more focus in their studies and they are going to understand the meaning of responsibility.

One of the reason why home school it's good for students is going to be that students are going to be more concentrate and focus on their studies. Students manage to work better if they are alone, since they do not have any distraction around them like: drama, bad influences, mean teachers, stress and so much more. This is really good for those students who want to get their stuff done and learn more efficiency. So attending to school from home is one good option for those who want to focus on their studies.

Responsibility is one of the most important skill that us like humans have to have. Being responsible is a hard skill to follow but it is the most important one since we use it on the daily bases. If students attend to be on home school they have to learn that is not easy and they have to be really responsible because they are not going to have a physical teacher in front telling them what to do. Therefore you have to get it by their on hands and learn the meaning of being a mature and a responsible person. Students are going to be more responsible because if thy have any project, homework or test they are going to manage the way to study and do their stuff by them self and using the tools of their online program.

I understand that some people may disagree and prefer students to go to a normal school since they are going to have more social life. Having social life it's really important but who said that being in home school means that they are not going to have any social life, it's the opposite because if students are all caught up with their things they are going to have so much time to hang out with friends and family.

In conclusion the benefits of being home school are really good since students are going to focus on their own things and studies also they are going to learn how important it's to be responsible. now days we use technology for everything because it let us have a lot of more options if people is struggling with school. so more schools should include some online programs for students who want to continue their studies from home. This is going to bring a big change in our community and more professional, responsible people. ",4.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But I don't think that it would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because, there are many reasons that the students could not able to learn home by yourself in online; which are that some problems, and communicating. Also there are more position to I disagree and agree with this argument.

Firstable, I think the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, it would not benefit for the studehts, because of the students could have some question that they don't know. And if someone who dont' teach with them, they cannot learn that more understable. And they migth cannot catch up their late works, because of they don't help anybody. I have an examples of that the girl who has taken an online classes, and she didn't go to the school, because she thought, the online class is better than to learn subjects and it doesn't have to do that everyday and she can study her subject whenever day she could. But she have to her exam in the school, and she didn't study as well as can't catch up her study work. Now she stopped to take an online class in the home and go to school. So, in my opinion, even thought the online class is giving you as more free time but if you can't study by yourself, It couldn't help you that learn.

Also, the students can't communicate with other students. It means that the student can't study with other students that they can't make some friends and could not be an active just like some other students. Also, it will be impact their behaviour that they'll be more lonely. Because the students behaivior is always changing and easy to get used to their environment, especially the high school students. Therefore, i disagree to attend classes from home by way of the online and video conferencing benefit for the students.

On the other hand, the online class is not really useless thing that for the students. Of course, It should be has some advantegious way to attend online and video class, which are it helps that the students could be more mature and more focusing on their work. And they have more free time because the student doesn't have to this everyday as a school, they can do that whatever time to working on it. So, we don't have to hold one point of view, we should try that two other sides. For examples, the every students are different way to study, we don't have to demand to do only one way,

they might be more interest with the online, video class and the other students could be more enjoy to attend this class. Consequently, every students who enjoy that much, they could take that class much easily to study in their home.

In conclusion, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but not all of students, because they all have a different way to study and somehow the student will need some help to support their what they are studying. In that case, students might be trying to give up to study alone. Therefore, the student might think very well to thier option to to attend classes from the home.         ",2.5
"Attend classes from home by way of online can be a good idea but , in my position is not a good way for the student and can be innecesary or bad idea in many reasons.

When the student is in home he going to do what he want he don't care the class he going to feel like if he don't have to do have to work in that class and he don't thing if he going to lost the class, one example is one of my friends he have a oline class but when he is in home he dont work because he dont care because no have one teacher who says ""Work or you no going to pass the class"" and thats one reason.

My second reason is when the student is taken online classes he just going to finish, he no going to learn because he dont care learn he just going to complete the leasons but just that, why? because he dont have the teacher who explaing when he have questions or when he is interesting in something of the class he no have the teacher who know more abaut that.

Some people says when the student take the online class from home he are more concentrade however whent the student take this classes from home he are more distractic because he have the cellphone in his hand or he have the TV in the room, the dog, the play station and he going to prefer play or see movies than work on the classes.

In conclusion thye student can no work , no have the teacher for question or warn he can lostr the class or are more distractict or prefer play than work on the class are my reasons for no take online classes but with the good students can be a good idea.",2.0
"Although some schools offer says that distance of learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because some students prefer take classes online and for this classes you have to pay, actually If you go to the school you'll have the capacity of learn more faster.

Although some schools offer says that distance of learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because there are 50% of students that prefer take classes online and they don't come to the school. I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because if they stay at home, they will have more time to spend with their family or make things that they would like to do. And students who stay at home they will have more time to studied another signature like math or they can learn another language. They can practice a sport or they can do whatever they want. If you take a video conferencing this will help you to understand your teacher because a video conferencing explain you what you need to do. And also you will see what is your teacher teaching you.

Reason 1, why students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because if they take classes online they will finish school more early. for example some classes online are more shorter than a school year. School year require have 315 days of classes and you have to be in the school for about 6 to 8 hours per day. And also they need to complete some credits to graduated. If you want to finish school you have to complete this credits. To have complete this credits you have to take some classes that are require to complete those credits.

Reason 2, why students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because if they studied at home they can go to doctor's appointment. There are 70% of students that doesn't come to the school because they have doctor appointment and they mostly are absent. Attendants is very important in the school because if you want to have good greats you have to come every day. If you take classes online you will have the capacity of learn more faster and whatever test that they give you online you'll available to past them.

Although some schools offer think that distance of learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would benefit at some students that choose studied online or by a video conferencing. There are a good reasons why students prefer to studied online. That's the majority of students prefer stay at home and take classes online.            ",3.0
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home than at school? I believe taking classes online at home could be very benificial, because you wouldn't have to worry about getting distracted by other students like you would at school. You'd be able to advance at your own pace, meaning you won't have to rush at everything. Lastly, you wouldn't have to be so stressed from all the homework you get from each teacher in each class, but everything has its disadvantages as well.

I'd like to start by saying that not being distracted from your class is great, most students get easily distracted by others. Anything that makes you lose your focus during class is considered a distraction, which includes even cellphones. If you don't pay attention to class your most likely going to end up getting lost and fail, but when your at home doing your work online by yourself you wouldn't have to worry about this.

Another benefit from being able to attend class at home, would by that you can move at your own pace. This is a big benefit, for example at school I have to follow the teachers pace and sometimes when the teacher moves to fast on a subject I end up confused and lost making me fail the test or not doing good on the homework. At home you could take your time to process and understand the subject before moving on to a different one. Helping you do a lot better.

My final reason would be less stress. I say this because I'm stressing right now to keep up my good grades. I get to much homework and most of the times I don't get time to do it because of work or family. I'm the oldest at home and I have to take care of my siblings, which means having to make food for them, clean up the house making sure everyones ok. Making me not do homwork after school. Most of the times I have to stay up late doing homework. I wouldnt have to worry about this if I did everything online making me less stressed.

I have given you three reasons on how doing your classes online can be benificial, but there are also some disadvantages. One of them could be not interacting with other students. I know that earlier I had said others can become a distraction but thats during class after class it's nice talking to others, everything has its time and place. Another disadvantage could be that you may need help with something and you won't be able to have someone to help. At school we have our teachers and when your stuck with something they can help you by explaining it in other words to make it sound more simple. So, there our benefits on having class online but also disavantages.

I end this essay by saying that I still believe taking online classes at home can benefit you a lot, But everyone has there own way of learning. If your more of a independant person than I would recommend taking online classes but if your more of a social person than stay in school. All that matters is that you pass your class.",4.0
"Well the best option for my is what you attend the classes from home by way of online .

My reason or my thought is, what you cant learn, in online classes, and thought what you can do it , doing others wor,k in you free time, and the school has good ideas for student what take, classes like after school just in home . So in my position is that because if you work so is you cant take the class for one hours, and you work ,and is more benefit for myself but ,each person has diferent ideas .

Examples:

If you not have work is more time for you ,for what you keep doing you class online.

If you wnat the class . you has more time for to think best for work online and make a good work and your class.

With this examples are much more for what you take any option or my option what is the best or most better already is in you home .

If you not have time like time complete is for that what you take this option ya what has work and not time like for stay in the school all the time .

Others examples is whent you have 18 year old has to much resposabilities and others case it 's not easy .

I think whent a teacher said you need that class is for one reason, and you nedd take that class but you cant took with you teacher what, is most better for you. So and my opinion or my position is take class from home in online, and to much better what ,take video coferencing.

One reason because im take that option is because in my home is relax, and with food and alone and not voices and nothing, and in my home take my time for think most better i think is the most important for my work in home and i think what the work in online is not easy so need my time for to think, and good ideas and good answer, and the idea is what you learn with any option you take for this case . The student in this time has more option for any problem . One reason for what i take this option is for the time ya what much student are major or not have much time for coming a school because the work or others case. Other reasons what the student take this option is beacuse is home not in other pleace ya what not has ride or cars for take that class or classes en other pleace .

My intentions is what others student take this option what is classes from HOME because is the best ,option for any case too if you want free time is more easy for you take this class or classes home by way of online, and is more choice that idea and minus dificult just what in home or online you not have teacher for explain any question so for that reason is little complicate but not impossible make you work so you cant do it , forever you want , nothing is this life is impossible but too not is easy everthing is sacrifice. Abd you has see you work good and past the class sin difucult .

My reference is the option class

FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE. Is the best option and more benefif for learn in home, and more easy for the time or others problem and i cant wait what everthing stay good for my cass or classes .

"In my opinion, they shouldn't let students attend class from home. Students do not attend their classes will most likely to slack off. Although it is a great idea, only the truthful will attend classes from home while the other student will be in school. Students need to be in school to social and get out of their house, students shouldn't be in their bed listening to the teacher and being lazy all day. Student needs to be in school.

From my point of view, students should be in school to socialist and need some fresh air. If a student stay home then they'll feel lonely, decrease their social skills, and be lazy. Due to this, students can develop some type of mental health problems if they stay in their house for a while, also some student who is in home will most likely skip school just to enjoy their day off. Teachers should know their students more. If a teacher knows who wants to learn then they'll most likely will focus on that student but if the student doesn't care then the teacher will try their best to help the student. Therefore all K-12 students should be in school and learn.

Even though you understand my argument however, I think the trustworthy students should attend class at home. If a student shows respect and work really hard, then they would most likely to attend class at home if necessary. Although it is best if they attend in class but if they are sick then they are welcome to attend class in home as long they listen to the teacher and take notes. But if they are really sick or any emergency, than they should email the teacher to let them know. Students should always let the teacher know when they are not in school and ask the teacher's permission to do a video conference.

Without a doubt, students should be in school to socialist and need of fresh air, I do believe that everyone will be good in class and show respect to any adults. All student needs to be healthy in a physical and mental way. Students need to be in school in order to build their social skills because that's part of life, to socialist people if they need some assists or you need some assists as well. However, if there's a trustworthy student who work really hard may attend class in home. But if a student is awfully sick and in crisis then he or she will email the teacher that they are not in school and ask if they can do the work next class or in the morning and lunch break. Whether or not I think all K-12 student should go to school and learn instead learning it from home.                ",3.0
"Some schools offer distance learning from there house students can learn from there homes by online classes and by doing video conferencing. i think students cannot get education for 2 to 3 hours by sitting home or by talking on video call. if you want to get education you need learning enviornment to learn something. you cannot learn anything by sitting in home some students get tired and sometimes you get lazy by sitting home and doing nothing. if you want to learn someting you have to be present in class physically and mentaly in order to learn something.

they should use these options when there is bad weather or ice roads outside so that studdents do not miss there education due to the bad weather students can keep up with there classes and with there grades.

i don't agree on talking online claases for whole year while sitting home sometimes you do not know how to solve problems while sitting homw some students do not have a wifi facility at there homes how they are suppose to take classes on online if they do not have laptop or wifi at there house. all the students should come to the school if they want to get education in order to get there diploma. students who do not have any source of coming to school but they do have laptops it can help them to get there diploma while sitting home.

students who got injuries and cannot come to school for 1 month because there doctor gave him or her bed rest for 1 month this option can help him so that he or she do not miss there whole month so that they can keep up with there grades so that he or she do not fall back and they can get there diploma.

some students who work 5 to 6 days in a week and cannot get up early in the morning this program can help them to get there diploma by staying and taking there test online and video conferencing with there teacher. i do not think all schools should start this program we all have to use techonolgy but you cannot learn whole year while sitting home and doing video call you have to be in learning environment to learn someting because when you get to the collage things are tottaly different no one gonna help you if you do not want to learn all the students have to do everthing by there self.",3.0
""" How village people get education ""

A village have a school and they are diside learning the people, they offer for distance learning. They do meeting for that and everybody agree for that. After few week start the class. Some students visit every where and they try to teach to viliage peoples and attend to them. They think village peoples learning everything . What they are need?

I think""yes"" students would benefit from being able to atted classes from home.

My first reason is some village have or had no one go to school. They just doing hard work. One day some peoples visit this village and they deside. They will be teach to them. Then, they are start the classes . Some people think it's crazy. When everybody learning they know it's good for everybody. They takeing online or video class for how they are makeing graden? how they are growing up? how they can't do hard work? First issue is how they thing about that?

My second reason is I think the peoples they don't doing any study they will be face the any problems. This why they need to study. some people thing study is bad thing of life. How we solve this problem? The people teach to them many things for examples:

1. Girls under 18 they don't get the married.

2. how control the birth?

3. They are need a nice future.

4. Boys and Girls need the education.

My third reason is I resoonse for the reasons because whole world peoples need the good educaton or genertion of future. Because who didn't get study they no how can talk to peoples. I agree for that because peoples need the educatoin. The village people now go to school and they send to child in school. They students help to them everything what they need to every daily life.

My conculation is one second, one minute, one day, one months,and one year peoples need the study or education. Because people don't get study the will be get poor. I'm agree with this school they deside good idea for the village peoples. The learning is don't finish because will leaning every day some thing new. Study can't be finished when you will be die. Also, they need to do how the students teach to them and how they are learning.

"for this issue, I think attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would not benefit. Students would not benefit to attend classes from home because not just for studying in books but we go to school for another reason also, for examples we go to school for getting friends and that mean we have social. And another is we can do activities that we get from some classes.

First, friends form school is the reason that students cloud go to school because they will get a good relationship and that mean they have a socialite. If students attend classes from home they might get just a thing that teacher teach them but they will not get a teamwork when they have any work group form teacher. They will not know how to be a teamwork or working with another people. When they graduate for high and get into college or apply a job and they never used to have a social it will not work for them because they do not know about teamwork or how to live whit a group of people.

Second ,it is about activities for student. When they study,some subject they have to go outside from school for studying ;sure as scenes classes would go to a sea for studying about a sea,so if they go and see a real sea, students might get information more than they get from a book and can feel it. Students should do activities and study in books together it might help students understand.

I think,student should go to school because I believe that we can do better when we do thing that not just read books or study at home but we should go to school fore getting better.         ",2.0
"Have you ever woke up one morning and thought ""man I want to do my classwork on my bed"" No? me either but I sure do think it is a good idea and let me tell you why. Students have been given the chance to work from home; instead of working in a classroom. Today I will explain why I believe students should be able to stay home instead of working from school. First reason would be you will be able to work at your own pace. For example whenever you have a test/quiz during school there is a time limit and you don't really focus while working on your test/quiz you focus more on the timing but, if you were working from home you would be able to work your pace with no worries about a bell ringing when your still on question 1. But if you were to work from home you would be able to cheat on the test or not even focus on it you could be watching TV while doing the test and that isn't the best choice but, there are ways to avoid that. Second Reason I would say is avoiding illnesses that could affect the whole school. Students do have signs almost everywhere telling them keep the school a clean place, wash your hands before stepping out the bathroom, and to keep your hands to yourself. But, sadly some students don't do that ; Now that the corona virus came out everyone is starting to be more clean but not really everyone but if you were home you wouldn't really have to worry about catching anything to make you sick unless one of your family members is really sick otherwise your good because in school theres like 1,000 or more people imagine how many germs are in the air. Not saying school is the cleanest place but our janitors do clean up after us everyday for it not to be clean but I just wouldn't believe it because there are still students that don't cover their nose/mouths when they sneeze or cough and you wouldn't have a problem if you were home. Last but not least my third reason would be less anxiety about school. As a junior I noticed many people have anxiety when it comes to school you worry about your looks, If you are smart enough, the way you say certain things I could go on with what students go through now a days people enjoy judging others even with not knowing them so it is hard to not have anxiety in school especially high school but at home you wouldn't really have to be worried or stressed about that you can be your own motivator your own hype man because no one is perfect. Now i'm not 100% sure about staying home and doing class from there would work out because not all students have the same mindset some like being in school because the teacher pushes them to do their work we all need a little push in life also some students can get away with so much from home if they were do a assignment or test you can just easily search up the answers. Some of my friends have done that when their teachers post things on Google classroom they don't usually do it themselves but, at the same time there is much benefits from working at home then in school not only do you get to sleep more but you also get to basically do your thing but your own way. Students working at home can make a student independent instead of being dependent on their teachers. As a student it is honestly up to you to go to class and to focus on what you are being taught it shouldn't be your teachers job to make you go to class everyday yes we all need a push in life but not every person is going to help you out you have to be independent most times. Students should work from home because in the real world not everything is going to be handed to you.",3.0
"Everywhere around the world is filled with negative energy. Most of it is caused by teenagers because they do not know between what is right and what is wrong. teens around the world resolved to violence, affecting others around them. Most of it is caused by bullying. Years ago the government allowed students to attend online courses and a good amount of students left high school and stayed to take online courses.

Students should attend online courses because bullying would decrease nand it would be easier to find your way through the website instead of walking from class to class.

Bullying would have a major decrease because students would be at home instead of school. Everyday students get harassed by other students and then up to the point where it drives them to commit suicide. Students would be at their house where it's safe and less distracting. Also, some students are too shy to be around other people so they get bullied for it. Every parent doesn't want to see their kid get bullied. There so much negativity being spread around and it not only affects the victims life it also affects their families.

It would be easier to find your way through online courses instead of walking class to class. It could be difficult for some students to find their way around the school because of how big it might be. With only the press of a few buttons, students would easily find their way towards their next assignment.

Others may think that taking online courses are a waste of time. Parents question the school district ""

if we have teachers then why do we need online courses?"".

Some students would feel a bit depressed knowing that all their friends are at school and they are the only ones at home looking at a monitor. It is more likely that kids won't be able to learn that way because they'll be distracted by other things. Students would prefer to be with their friends and listen to a teacher in person and have less work.",4.0
"Let me ask you this question What's better then waking up and, knowing that you are getting your education at home? with that in mind Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. I think students will highly benefit from atending classes from home. Because not everyone learns the sameway. some students struggle to stay in school all day and, most of them can't listen to teachers talking for 90 minutes straight.

I feel like less students will drop out of high school. Some students are anti social and, don't like being in a place where everyone likes to judge you or, talk about you. Students don't have to stressed out about work that is not finished in class so, homework will be a thing in the passed. People like me will have more time to play sports and, be with family. Most people carrey a ten pound backpack but, with online classses all your work will be saved in a computere. The will hightly benefit people who are not the best with keeping papers in order. The future are our computers and, builting a strong skill with computers is a great treat to have.

Online classes is the future and the future is here. Students are benefiting from online classes but, some students comeback into public schools because they learn better face to face with a teacher, and not steering at a screen all day. Alot of colleges accept students who got their diploma online but, studies showed that a lot of students who got their education online had a hardtime adopting into the colleges. I still feel like online classes is the better chioce we been following the same school systeam for more then 100 years It's time for change!",3.5
"I don't think students would be benefit to attend classes from home.

Reasons

1-difficult.

2-Get distracted.

3-confused.

First i don't think students would be benefit to attend classes from home. It can be hard if they don't undertand something. Is not the same the class in the computer to have a tecacher explaining you. If you have a question it's difficult to ask to the computer unlike to ask to a teacher.

If they get lazy they can say they going to take the class later. if they want to watch a movie they going to forge thinks about the class. They can get distracted for anything like the phone,music,and the TV.Attend class from home would not benefit students if they want to hang out with their frinds they can leave the class in any moment unlike if they have a teacher giving the the class in the school they can respect the class,put more antention,and understand better the class.

Third i don't think students would be benefit to attend class from home they can get confused with the class. if the take the class online they can read the direction but sometimes even reading the directions students get confused.

is better to attends the classes in the school so a teacher can help students with anything students will need. teachers have the experience to explain students what they need to do about the class. attend classes online students basically are alone so is more confused to understand the class. in school if students get confused they can ask to someone else to understand. at home they dont have anybody so they have to think alot to understand. attend classes from home can affect students grades for less knowledge about the class unlike in the schools they have many opportunities to learn better.

In conclusion students would not be benefit to attend classes from home they can get distracted for anything. It can be more difficult to them to undertand the classes. they can get confused with things about the class for not have a teacher with them personality to be helping them to undertand the class.",3.0

Today in the actuality is easier to take classes or courses, online or video conference, because the system of education is always trying to improve them self as everything in the world. The internet is our big source that we need everywhere and in different circumstances and the technology is a big advance that has a lot of benefits for us, like make our life easier.

My point of view about the student attending classes from home. First, most of the students in High School are teenagers, if they are in their homes taking classes it make the possibility that they do not socialite with the people and they can not find a firm personality. Second, the students could have problems in their vision in cause of the long time looking a monitor, laptop, tablet, Etc. Third, some of the students are beneficiary of their free lunches in school, so, if they are in home it will be more expensive for the parent to pay extra food. To conclude, those were some of my points of views or disagrees about attend to school from home.

This is a list about the agrees and it could be a benefit in my opinion:

Do not have to spend gas going to school.

Do not spend in different clothes everyday.

The government, do not have to pay a lot of teachers, so maybe taxes can get lower.

We can use a different schedule to see classes, and the other time to work.

The students do not have to socialize with the teacher, so, no disagrees and problems between the student and the teacher.

This ideas was basically what i think about attend classes from home, maybe it could be better or maybe no, the mostly reason i think is fine to attend school from home is, if you have a disability or sickness that don't let you go to school.

"School provide Teaching to those Students that can not assist to School, How? , well so many students have many problems to arrive to School. One of them is that They do not count with Transportation and they live far away, or some students that have special cases. So Today some School give you the option to teach you from School.

You must have a computer or device that allow you communicate with schools, if not, you won't be able, The only way that you can learn from home it's internet, but at the same time there are people that can buy those resources.

Study from home have pros and at the same time cons, pros are those can help you to learn the same themes that students learn at school, also you get you degree and can Apply to colleges, but, there is the case that they won't have a healthy and normal life at college.

Learn from Home is that you can finish it in the time that you want it, you can spent your time as much you want and finish it , but, what are you going to do after finish it?.

People that learn from home do not know what is converse with people around them, That is a big problem that can affect their life in future, They won't know where they at, or how talk with another person. That can be so stress, often they will feel exclude from their milieu.

Learned from home could help you to skipped school and you won't have to wake up early but, is not going to be the same that a regular student got in a normal school, why?, because a normal student can talk and ask his doubts in issue of time. They have many resources that School can give you. If you are learning from home, you won't be able to ask and resolve your doubts, you will have to search by yourself and figure it out.

We can not forget that people that have special cases, well, that people have at the same time special programs that school offers, some Schools are able to receive them and work with them at school, and other Schools can give you an option to work from your home, Those programs were designed only for people that born sick or have problems since born.

If you don't want to go to School, you must have a reasonable excuse, because you have to apply for it, you can not decided that you're not going to School because you don't wan't it, and you want to learn from home. Specially from public school that request a letter and proofs that you can not assist to school, and then They will analyze your case.

Today you have the resource to learn from home, you should think about it, don not make mistakes that can affect your life in future. At least you have a special case. There are many solutions that can help you and you can triumph.       ",3.0
"Studies have shown that there is a 25% higher passing rate from students that attend to online classes. If it wasn't for the advance tecnology the world has today there wouldn't be things like online schools. Now and days everyone has tecnology ether in their pockets due to there cell phones or at home with their laptop's , computer's , gaming system's and their smart tv's.

Now with this new technology the school systems' have taken advantage by making online classes, Therefore students are able to attend classes form the comfort of there own home. Some schools are given the students the option to choose between online classes or going to normal school classes.

Some would say that online classes would not benefit students i'd say they are wrong. These are some reasons i think that online classes are better and benefit's way more than normal school classes, because there are no distractions in online classes. In online classes students dont have to deal with things like waking up early, people , and much more. I had a cousin that took online classes and what i saw she was able to start when she was free she'd finish in two hours or less, Then the program would let her know when she'd finish the leason of the day. She was a teen mom and when she found out how easy taken online classes were she got support from the family as she finished with the help of online classes and her family she got her life together.

The people that say that online classes aren't beneficail might not have gone through what 80% of people have gone through. Here' an example in regular school classes there are distractions everywhere like friends, other class mates, teachers, aslo the fear of getting bullied. When someone has friends in class they much rather talk to them then to pay attenion in class. When in class you might no peolpe and it may get into your head which would give you another distracion. Now with a student that is in online classes won't have to worry about those issuses.

Even the simple things could affect your ability to be able to learn like what you eat. If you dont eat anything during the day you get hungry and that becomes a distracion. In most schools they serve horrible food with that students feel sick after eating. now a benefit with having classes online people can make food at home. After an heathly and amazing lunch they are ready to learn and too pay attention.

Not only is things like food vary inportant but time is another one. Due to bad habbits people go to sleep late and then they have two hours of sleep and going to school. Once class starts they fall asleep and dont learn anything. Since schools start early makes it wrose for the ones who go to sleep late at night. The lack of sleep affects the student mentally and physically, With a student that is in the online class can start when ever there free.

Last but not least what most of the students fear the most is bullying. In normal schools studies have shown that 80% of students have been bullied. That would mean if there were a table of ten students

8 out of those 10 students where bullied. Many people fear of getting bullied since what it was done to many students through out the years. What it dose is it makes school not feel safe for them and then they want to stop going. Now with online classes students shall not fear in getting bullied since they would take there classes in there house.

In conclusion i believe that online classes are the best and have the most benefits due to all the examples i've given. From lunch, time, distrctions and bullies those are the reasons students have a hard time to focuse in regular school classes. A huge thanks to the new tecnology for being able to help us learn without the struggle and fear. What i saw my cousin go though i can say online is the best piont blank. I've given all tmy examples and details also personal storys on the benefits of online school that is all i have to offer fairwell.",3.0
"This is about if i suport students atending class online at home?

i think that yes if they put their mind to it. And i think if they want to pass all their grades if they are doing school at home and they really want to do it then yes If they do the all their sentens well and all their paragh well.

Aslo i think that if they are home schooled that they might do the work when they want to do it some of them will not care about it and some might just forgetand outher will say they will do it latter.

Sometime the mom/dad dose not help the student but most of the time the student want to do home school and want to pass then yes it depends on the student. when any student dose school at home they will often not do the work they aslo dont learn all the things the the school teaches they learn what the mom/dad knows.

I will say i suport it but i also dont suport becuas like i said most kids dont do the work but also some do the work. most kids when they are home schooled the mom/dad send them to school becuas they dont know what elas to teach them some just do it just to get school over with and when the mom/dad send them to school they some times llike but they aslo end up droping out of school.

Most student do benift from atending class at home but if they put their mind to it and do the work some time they learn like that becuas theirs no one that bothers them they do the work at their own speed on what they know.

most student come to school when they are home school they dont know most of the things that they learning that is becuas they didn't learn much when they where atending the class at home online becuas they were offten on their phone most of the time not caring about the work, or becuas they sleep late. Some student do know more when they are home schooled some times more then what they a student that gose to public school.

but most students that are home school they some times want to go to public school they want to go beacus they want to learn more thing make frend they rather go to public school to learn more beacuas they benn doing home school for most of the school year. some time its beacuas of their mom/dad scared that some thing might happen to their kid they dont trust their kid going to public school beacuas they might do some bad thiing.

im sure that students benefitfrom home school some take colleg class at home some start their corears but taking online class at home or some just do the things/follow the step their perent.

sometime when they are home schooled they have to go to school beacuas they have family problems or beacuas they just dont like being home scholled no more beacuas they want to do more things they wan tot learn more beacuas they feel like they are not learing the thing that they are learnig at home.

The things they learn some times aint right if they are learnig it frome their mom/dad if they are not doing the class online. But i think if they are doing the online class doing what they have to do to know what they want to be in life get thru all the the online class.",3.0
"There are so many reason the student are need to be discarded with the prompt, ""Some school offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way online or video conference. They are need to be disagree, because the school offer different kind the program to the student will be success on life. The school can provide us too, some career to start doing and learning what they want to be in the future. The bond more important in this life is the school, because can show us find our real self. The school can provide to be success on life, and can prepare to get better education.

The school provide us to be success on life on different way. The school is really good fundamental step, to teach us what the student want to be on the future and prepare for it. For example two year ago I meet a friend on Cuba who never went to school, he always been saying I dont want my expend my time on the school, when i can work and make really good money. For this moment is really good, because he dont has bill to pay, but after that he grow up. When he has to pay his own bill, and the money is not enough. So his Mon always been saying to him please Generic_Name go to the school, so one day he took the world to his Mon and for this he start to going to school again to the normal person. Generic_Name try to be success on the life and help his Mon what she need doing the right thing. So he never give up and he study hard to graduated. So he complete his goal and now he study doctor on the university, and making good money. This is a really good example to never give up and always need to follow our step no matter what.

The school can prepare the student to get more education . Basically the student past more time on the school than the house, its considered to us to the second house. The teacher teach to us what is the basic thing to respect each other and the main thing prepare us to the career that the student want to get in the future. The education the school bring to us are really important to find our self and to build our goal. Therefore the school is one of the main thing that was invented, because for this way the student can study the career that they want it. The school and the education the school bring always was been considerate the more important step on our life to create our way in the life

Some people may say to have home school is better because the teacher can explain to us most better. But they are wrong because the student can learn more doing the right on the school, can have more time with the teacher to do the homework etc. The school is really good please to find yourself making friend, playing sport. The student learn how to grow up with the person doing the right things. The always come to the school is a really good step to build the student future.

Basically I talked about "" Some school offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way online or video conference. The student who come to school the teacher can prepare most better to the future. The school is a really good bonds to us to choose what we want to do. The education that school bring to are really good, because help us to success and grow up like a normal person. The school is always be really nice that the student never forget, because is there what the student decide to do in the future.",3.0
"There is a debate today day about whether the students should study from home or school. Many people agree that the appropriate way to study is going personal to the school. My idea is that they are well understanding when the students go to the school because they have mutiple attention. Here are some reasons why many students master a course in school rather than online courses. First they can ask questions at any time, second improvement on learning new topics, and last friends support in group work.

First, many teenagers who take online courses still have questions or guesses on their answers. Here some reasons why many on the students does not master some courses. The classes related with Math, Chemistry, and History are the complicated for most learners. Those who are assisted by a teacher are the ones with the chance of clarify any problem related with numerical or logic problem; also the teenagers can make corrections in their work by asking for solutions. While the students with online courses are involved with more guesses, but the course program does not provide clear answer or does not provide an answer.

Second, the improvements in schools classes vary depending the faculty member you are with. Online games made by the teachers related with the actual topic makes the topic easy by practicing in the game, also entertain them at the same time keeping their minds relaxed and widely open to process more information within the game. Other teachers prefer individual activities with certain amount of exercises provided in previous classes. Those improvements help to find new ways to solve a problem, hints, and interpretation of the problems. The online courses does not provide incentives for students allowing them to decrease the interest in the process.

Finally, friends. They provide self confidence by asking an unclear problem and having different points of view at the same time. The opinions provided for the people you know encourage them to keep it up; there's some times the teacher explanations does not clarify at all and your group provides detailed explanations of a process. The efficiency in the group is enforced by dividing the labor and finishing soon; them the work can be shared with the people at the table, explaining how the process was made, and at the same time they can make corrections in what the other person have done. Different than the online practice made by the person self can take weight longer to get an specific difficulty.

Those are the reasons why many people prefer the schools rather than house. The help in questions by the teachers, improvement in learning in different ways, and the support of people you know and you feel confident with. Those reasons allow students to be better at something they aren't with the help of someone that knows more about the course. This people that provide assistance is a boost to keep track in school related.",3.5
"This essay is about some schools offer distance learning as an option for the students attend classes form home by way of online or video conferencing , I think some students would benefit from take classes by their houses, because some students work in the night this is a problem for the students who working in the night because the school start 7:30 this is to early for some students because they work and they don't sleep well.

Example one is about my friend he work after school sometimes he work between

5 to 12 and he after this he need to wake up at 5 for go to the school , I think this is heavy for him because he always is tire in the first class because he can sleep well in the night , but he need to graduated from high school because this is the only way he can have a better life. Many students in high school work after school , I think this program can help they because they can continue working and they can sleep more , this can help they to have a better grades because they can sleep more because sometimes they have a bad grades because they don't have the time to do the homework and the study for the test .

Example 2 is about the many girl in high school are pregnant , this program can help this girls because I see many girls don't want to return to high school , when they are pregnant because when they're pregnant sometimes people say bad thinks about they ,because they're to young for have a baby. but with this program they can take the classes from their houses .This can help they to graduated from high school because this is a better way to completed their classes , cause sometimes many girls decide to continue in the normal schools but when they have the baby they can not to continue because they need to take care for the baby. but with this program they can finish their classes.

For my conclusion this is a good idea because they can help many students who have some problems . because they can finish high schools , because they don't have time because sometimes they need to work. but with this program they can help this students because this is a good idea for help this students . because they can benefit if they take the classes from their houses.",2.0
"Some schools offer an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools think that it is a benefit that help students who don't want to go school or if they have diseases, they can't go schools. Taking classes in home or schools have some similar benefits but not overall benefits.

Although, I think taking classes from home have benefits and not because some students have health problems and it is not a benefit because students can't learn good like in school.

At first, taking classes from home can be a benefit because it helps students who have health problems like students that have problems to walk or different disease. Also, for students that their parents don't let them to go for problems. For example, if students who have arthritis, they can't go to schools because they can't walk. It would be better for they because taking classes by online or they can make a video conferencing with a tutor. They can learn about all classes they want to know and it would be a benefit for their future because they will get a diploma that will be help for them. Also, it can be a benefit for students that had problems in schools like fight with others students. Those students can take classes in home with help of someone or by online. In this way, they can get help and learn things without go school.

Moreover, I think it is not a benefit for students who don't want to go schools because if they don't like the schools, they will be doing whatever they want because there won't be a teacher who tell them what to do; and they can't learn good because there are no one who explain them the class. There are many students who don't speak English and they don't want to go school but they want to learn. For example, I can't speak English so good because I am not a native American, so if I don't want to go school and want to learn the language, taking classes from home would be hard for me because in home I will learn slower than schools because in schools are many people speaking English and in home I just hear one time at day. It better if I hear English the most of the time because I can learn so fast because I will make friends to help me. For me, taking class in schools is better than home because now I go to school and it is hard even if I go to school. I am improving the language with help of teacher and friends.

In conclusion, taking classes from home is not a hundred percent a benefit. It just have some benefits for some students. For some students taking classes from home is hard because they don't learn too much. Overall, if I take classes in home or school,

it is something relevant because even if I am in one or anther place, I am learning something. It is not a thing of other world. It is just for students that have the purpose to learn and be someone in life. Going to school help me to improve my life each day. Each day, I can learn something new and now my language is improving because I have people who want to teach me and I am a stronger person because no one can laughing of me because I am learning.

"Students now can take classes from their houses. Schools are offering students the possibility to take classes online from their houses, I think is a excellent idea because sometimes students dont have the possibility on getting a ride to get to school, or it makes it easier for students that have to stay home for personal reasons, or even if you want to take a class during the summer to get more credits and get to graduate earlier.

Sometimes students do not have the possibility on getting rides to school and the county do not offer them a bus transportation system that can take them to school, for example in my country Costa Rica there is not a free transportation system to get to school and the only transportation system is the public one and you will have to pay for it, its an excellent idea from the schools to have this kind of classes that you can take from your own house.

Some students have reasons that make them stay home, such as girls being pregnant, students taking care of their parents that need people to take care of them because they are sick or have any disability and they can not stay home alone, in those cases students can finish their school courses at home and take care of their loved ones at the same time.

Some students just do it to finish high school earlier, they have the opportunity on taking classes online during the summer and be able to get less classes on their senior year or just graduate earlier if they taking the standard diploma, that is a smart thing to do if you are planing on go to college and finish your carrier on a young age, and start working at young age too.

On my opinion I think that having that opportunity is a good thing and a bad thing because going to school is the best decision that you can make on your life, you get to make friends and get to know a lot of people during all the time you spend at school, but not everyone have that opportunity, thats why this opportunity that the school is giving you is unique and can help you a lot, the only thing you need is a computer or a electronic device that can get access to the internet.",4.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that students will benefit more from distance learning than from going to school. Not everyone agrees that going school is for them. Distance learning is gives a better chance to learn all your education.

Here are a couple reasons why I support the idea of distance learning.

First, reason why I think that distance learning is more beneficial to you is because you can manage your time better with class work and classes. You have the opportunity to work on your own schedule. Separate the classes throughout the day instead of all bunched up at once. More time for you to focus on either classes you kind of struggle with or classes most important. All work does not have to have a due date or time limit. You can take your time to understand the material at hand and do all your work when capable.

Secondly, the more comfortable the environment the better you work. Schools environment isn't so good for students, sometimes we sit in classes where its hard to learn. Hard to learn because a lot of kids do not take there work serious, stay off task, and distract others from learning. That harms the learning environment makes kids get a little frustrated at times with there work. Its not easy to do your work while not being able to concentrate correctly and being distracted. When you are in a comfortable environment, work is not so complicated. You can relax, think straight, and focus on the task at hand with no problems. Being able to attend class from home keeps you away from the bad environment.

Last but not least, the safety of the students is always important. While in school kids can be harmed in different type of ways. Some get bullied others get into altercations. This is hard to stay away from because you are in school and it surrounds you. This can definitely throw off a student and get them off track. When kids start to think about many other problems instead of there school work it is not good. Attending your classes at home, online, or through video conference is the safest way to attend. You wouldnt have to worry about the school drama or the bullies. Your mind will be strictly focused on the work you have to do and nothing less.

In conclusion, the idea of students attending classes from home, video conference, or online. Is most beneficial because of there safety, work environment, and schedule. I agree with my reasoning and support them to the max because distance learning is the best way to learn. Your student should give distance learning a chance its worth it. ",4.0
"On my Opinion i think is a good way to the student that they can take classes on online or on video chat is a good way to do it, because some students sometimes some of then they live so far of the school so they dont have other way to educate they self and i think is a good communication to learn.

Is a good benefit because is a easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school are closed. And they close the school because the students can not trasportate to the like that because the streets are freeze and really complicate to transport to the school.

If i have to take classes on online or video chat i will because more easy for me and is not difficult to learn on online or video chat. And because i can have more free time i can do more things and i can have a job.

And think too for some student is not good because they dont have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online or they dont have internet is difficult for them. Is a good option online classes but not for all students some of them are benefit and some of them dot.

Only classes are a good reason to use because is a good way to cominitate in a long distance, but Free online schools, have to be free all schools online for all students they dont have to pay nothing.

The time if they take online classes they they go not miss nothing because they can star when they want.

On my oponion is a goog way to do it.     ",2.0
"This teens manual I talk to talk about expectation. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

The first I ready to talk about some expectation. That's great to some students learning option to take some class in home, for example, some people do others things to help in home one example is he/her work in some place to help his family. Other example, regularity students nope have the opportunity go to the schools because the students things they not equality or things he/her can't do anythings to learning. I support the way to some teachers or one person is working to schools or some people have permission to teacher to go the house the person nope lost any classes they provide.

The another reason, Responsability, for example,

the place where I born people need to walk a lot distance to go learning and graduation some teachers sometime they go to the house where you live to teachers somethings to you. Other example, some time the people nope have transport or some people not have money to pay the transport to go schools. To graduate or learning more you do a lot things to graduate, however, if you put you responsibility you can do a lot or things to learning. Always the people is intelligent to great in school they can obtain beneficial scholarship to helping you and the family.

Reason of this teens. People take classes the way online, some examples, a lot people taking that's way because some people are elder; but they things is better to graduate because he/she work and others things. Some people things that's is more better for then I things that's is great to do both side. People can helps another person or example some reason why he/her taking that's journey to graduate. Always one person in class is coming four or less days to schools the attends is so bad students things is better go to work that's why a lot students take that's route. Some students don't matter anythings about the school, however, students particularity not a lot both some person things bad.

Next reason, offer to learning to night is better too, for example, some people things that is better option too, however, not a lot person have some opportunity to attend classes in home in the morning or late. A lot students take the opportunity to finish the school online. Person take that opportunity is because they have another weigh, for example, they go to work or stay in home to do nothing about his life.

That's great to some students learning option to take some class in home, for example, some people do others things to help in home one example is he/her work in some place to help his family. The place where I born person walk a lot distance to learning and somethings to graduation some when teachers sometime they go to the house where you live to teachers somethings to you. People can helps another person or example some reason why he/her taking that's journey to graduate. Some people things that is better option too, however, not a lot person have some opportunity to attend classes in home in the morning or late. My options I take the position to learning or finish my high school online, because that's really great to explain another person your experience about to finish school online. Always the person things somethings they not have good ideas to his life or something similarity. Opportunity great things for the person have major action.

Great take both ideas in this teens.  ",2.0
"Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home help then not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by students getting to much school work that cannot all handled in one night. Everyday kids complain about having to much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at home gain more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at school helps kids to succeed and have better grades. No only does learning at home provide less distraction, it provides students with flexible schedule.

First, Students complain about having to much homework because students who spend a lot of time on their homework and don't have enough free time for them to relax is considered having to much homework. When they get out school and they have to practice some sports them they have to go to their house just to eat and them to do their homework, they cannot spend time with their family. Homework can limit the time. Students can spend with their friends, family, or other activities they can do. Too much homework can also give students more pressure from parents interference, this may cause unhealthy amount of stress. This is why students prefer home school.

Second, One of the best things about home school is that It can be done at anytime because It can be done at any time, children have a flexible time schedule with mean that the parents can helps. The student can work around schedule instead of the parent working around the students schedule. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. Home schools allow students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homeschooling is that there are not rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules, the students can focus on their studies.

Third, when you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are may distraction that can make students loss focus on what there are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit student. Learning from home won't have the distraction that that a classroom has. As a result of this, student won't loss focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reason students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment they are no familiar with, which makes then feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In a school, you are stuck at desk for 6 hours and have limit time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This does not helps students at all. In conclusion, the environment at home will benefit student's by giving them better grades.

In conclusion, Students should be offered classes online because the environment is less stressful, which could benefit test scores. At home there is less distractions, rather than at school where are many different things to worry about. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. Many students successfully take some, and even all, classes from home. School systems and all districts should offer distance learning. ",4.5
"Some students would benefit if they understand things easily without a teacher explaining everything and if they don't need help like in math, but other students would not benefit if they don't understand things ,and if they need extra help or ask questions that will be a problem for them taking classes online or video conferencing.

Student who would benefit are those who understand things easily, and if they want to be alone to have a better concentration in what they do classes online is a good option because they will be taking solo training, and it's comfortable to take these classes without going to school they would have more time in home for example, I preferred to take classes online because that will give me more time to prepare everything that I need to go to work, because when I arrive from school to home, I have to do everything really quick ,things that I have to do like wait for my little sister in the bus stop from school then, I have to cook ,and that takes me time, and I have to be ready at 3:30pm to go to my work ,but classes online would benefit me because, I need help understanding classes like geometry or English is not easy for me to understand some words in English, and I need to ask a lot of questions.

Students who would not benefit are those who like to be with friends in school and talk with people that can be an issue for them because taking classes online they will be alone, and they could have some possible technological problems, and if they don't have self-control having a computer in front of them certain time of the day they would not be successful with classes online.

Some people think that students who take classes online don't make the same effort like those who take classes in school , because they don't wake up in the morning to take the school bus like normal high school students do ; however ,I think that students that take classes online male the same effort because they need to have time to take those classes and they have to respect the schedule that teachers give to them to attend class, they have to be in front of the computer a lot of time that can is not good but they do it because they want to graduate like other students wants.",3.5
"Some people think that taking classes from home is a easy way to study without having to leave home. While others think that students would not be able to learn as much as they would attending to school. For some this is a big deal while others justify this as a modern way to study. Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work,not everyone has access to internet,teachers would help the students more in person That through a computer.

One of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea that students would no be inspired. Meaning that being studying from home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school would help students to focus in what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things.

Another reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seems good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have a internet source. There could be paces where getting good

Internet connection could be tough because of the location or weather. This issue have people saying that access to internet is a problem when it comes to study from home.

One more reason is than teachers would help the students more in person than trough the computer. Talking to though computer is not the same as talking in person .People say that students would best understand things their teachers teach them in person because they would explain with more details. Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side.

Meanwhile people still argue about this issue and that should be a way to solve it. Attending classes from from is not alway a good idea beacuse students would not be inspired,not averyone has acces to internet,and teachers would help students more in person. With all said we can conclud that the best way to study is by attending to school and no from home.",3.0
"""I don't need to go to school for to learn new things, I can learn the same things in my home"" Some students believe that is not necessary go to school to learn because they can attend classes from home. Some schools offers distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. This is a good option for students whose can not come to school for their jobs or their kids but, they want to study and to get a High School Diploma. The majority of people assure that students need come to school for to learn but, they are wrong because students can learn the same things at home. Many students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

First, Some students can not come to school everyday because they have a full-time job and their parents do not support them. For example, Many students do not have the same opportunities than others students so, they have to become independent. As a result, they have to leave from their homes and to find a job so, they sacrifice to study because they don't have time to come to school. With this option, they can go to work then, they can take their classes at home after work without to feel pressure by their responsibilities.

Second, This option can avoid the absents for students don't like come to school. For example, Some students don't like come to school and they prefer stay at home because they are attacking by schools' bullies. These students feel more confident in their home than in the school and, they believe that this option is the best way for to solve their school's problems. They also prefer this option because they are shy and they don't like to speak or to do presentations in front of the class by the students make fun of them.

Another reason for this option can would help many students is the students have kids and they can not come to school by their kids because they don't like that another person take care their kids and they prefer stay at home with their kids than come to school. Attending classes from home is an excellent strategy for students whose can not come to school by their kids because they will can take the classes and to get a High School Diploma without to leave their kids with someone else.

As you can see, Many students would benefit form being able to attend classes from home because it's a big opportunity to finish their High School even if they can not come to school frequently by their jobs or kids. It also helps students don't feel confident in the school for schools' bulliers or their feelings.         ",3.0

"Dear, Generic_School.

For some of the students, school is really far away for them, some student arent able to be in school for there health issues or gifted youngsters, is a really wonderful thing that the schools are offering online classes for the kids, it can really be a big help for there parents and there children.

My aunt, she has two children and one of them is gifted she can't walk normally, my aunt works everyday and is really frustrated , she has to take her to school everyday in the morning and take her home in the afternoon, from there home to school is like a 30 minutes of a ride and the way back , there is no bus able to take her where she lives , during the winter she wasn't a fan of the cold, the kid mostly feel sick during winter season, during at that time every morning they go outside to the car so my aunt can drop her to school she always felt sick, she was not able to attend school normally, it is really hard for my aunt, i told my aunt about the offer that the school are gonna make, about the online school and she really supports that decision she told me "" That would it be a wonderful thing for me and my child"" she is really joyful about the offer that the schools are making,

I fully do support this offer, from the schools having online classes it does help a lot of kids and parents, with they struggles and timing at home, it will be a big help for the counties of Generic_City, we want all the kids to learn at same time so they can be prepare for there future.

Thank you for your time.

"Although, people would like to be taking there classes online because people would rather sit at home on there computer than actually go to school and sit in class and listen to there teacher.

I mean I see why people would choose that for an example say if your late to class. You won't be because your taking online classes and you have so much time to get ready. When you have school you have less time to get ready even to have breakfast.

If your feeling sick for the people that take online classes it's much easier for them because that can sit in bed and do there homework. Even if they have a doctor appointment for being sick they can just sit in the wait room in that time being they can just do there work while they wait. If they don't Internet they can just use hotspot.

When your on a vaction won't have be worry about miss school work because your taking online classes. Even if your on another state you can still do the online classes. Plus, the online classes only taking like an hour to finish.

If it was me to chosse if I want to take online or just normal school. I'll pick school because it's much easier for me to learn because teachers would make sure your learn by making take test or quizes. Plus, your can stay after school if your miss one day of school.",3.0
"Have you ever wanted to know if your attending a classes from home does it benefit you ? Many students want to be educated and successful but, many problems come in there way causing public or private schools not to be the best decision for them. They decide they want to do school online and have said it has befitted them so much because, when they were doing public school they were failing there classes or the problems they were facing got harder for them to be in school. Many students have done online school and have been so successful and not only being successful but it has benefited them in whatever situation They're in right now.

Although some may argue otherwise, but through family experiences, prodcasts i've watched on the radio, and from hearing some celebrities talk.

One of my cousins named Generic_Name has been through so much and has not been able to continue going to public school. she's struggling a lot trying to keep her grades up and trying to get to school on time. she has an eating disorder. An eating disorder can be really hard at times when dealing with that and school . Her family has decided to let her do online school , and has helped her so much because while being at home eating and also going to doctor appointments she has the option to do her assignments online and also sometimes some teachers come to her house do homework assignments with her that help her a ton. Through online school she has overcame her struggle with her eating disorder and has also been so successful. As many years went by she has studied more an more. ""it's so crazy""

because while having so many problems she was facing she became a lawyer.

Some may argue that it's impossible how she became a lawyer after just doing online school, that its unfair how she got to where she is now because of home schooling, some people may say that by doing online school it can't benefit you nor can it make you a successful person it's just they way to failure. That's not true because when you hear so many stories and people talking about their experiences with home schooling you have to take to consideration that maybe it helps some and not others.

Many prodcasts on the radio have mentioned many real life situations on this subject . One i've heard that struck out to me was when this mom was talking about her son Generic_Name being really popular on social media, She said that all throughout his high school years students his age and older have been bullying him and trying to get in fights with him for no reason. The mom signed her son up for online schooling. Generic_Name did online school as well as he did video conferences with his teachers every other day . Generic_Name has found it to be more easy he said that he is more concentrated because, it's just him and his laptop there's no distractions no more students bothering him trying to fight him. Since social media is such a big thing to keep up with when doing online school ,he can do both social media and be educated. However, some may argue that Generic_Name has to be a man and grow up, he can't always hide from people that are mean to him. That's true he can't always hide from people like that, but if he's fed up with it then maybe it was the best decision you can only handle so much hate.

Celebrities have talked in their interviews about them choosing home school over school and how beneficial it was to them. There's this girl named Generic_Name .She said Being big on social media is really hard Dealing with the hate, dealing with people exposing you constantly for nothing, dealing with your name always being in people's mouth. Generic_Name has said that she's been bullied so many times and has found it harder for to deal with it. She has said that at one point she got depression and got harder and harder for her to continue going to public schools. Teachers recommended her to do online school. She took that advice and did home schooling for the rest of high school and also did online school for college as well. She said that she feels more successful. Generic_Name said that online school was the best thing she did and that she decided that for college she is going to a public college and she is also going to continue being big on social media. Some may argue that, They don't see how it benefited her. It have a major change on her, she knew what she wanted to do or be so how did it benefit her. It benefited her in so many ways, she no longer is afraid of what people think of her on social media. Sometimes people need space from public school and then when they feel that they are ready they can go to public schools again.

The importance is for people that are going through the same problems for them to look and read from past experiences. For them to see if online school is beneficial for them. In the future people can look back at this and see what people were going through and how much they were struggling. This helps to see about how the past was like to compare to how it's like now. A solution is for people to do online school if they feel like being in public school is harder for them or for, whatever reason it may be. Also for people to notice and to realize that as being said multiple times that for people that are big on social media It's hard to cope with all the hate they get. A solution is for people not to give hate to others. ",3.0
"The idea of schools allowing their students to take classes from home is is an excellent idea. Not all students learn the same way,or at the same pace as everyone else. Having the opportunity to learn in a way that is most comfortable for you, can really show improvements in grades. Students who are sick and are not able to attend school also have an advantage of doing missing work from home. This will give students no excuse for being behind with school work if their able to do classes from home.

Students that are often sick, or miss a lot of school because of personal reasons would have an advantage with doing their classes from home. If students have the opportunity to do classes from home they dont have to stress about returning to school, and having a lot of class work to make up. Therefore, students will no longer have an excuse for failing classes because of absences if they have the option to do it from home. When i had my surgery last school year it was nearly impossible for me to catch up on all my missing work, the only way i could do my class work was if someone picked it up from school. Unfortunately my parents both work so while i was out of school i had no way to do it from home. It was very difficult to finish all that work after getting back, because i was not given many options of getting the work done. If i was given the option to complete my class work from online this would have really helped me maintain my grades up.

Seniors might be in the position where they need more than the usual amount of classes to graduate by their final year. Having to be in such a difficult position and only being able to attend morning or night school can make it harder to get these classes done on time. This will only make it stressful, and discourage students to get the classes done by the time of graduation. Not only do some seniors have jobs after school but having to attend a full day of school, and either morning or night school can be tiring and overwhelming. Overdoing yourself can also decrease the amount of people that pass their classes because of the reason that they have to much to get done in a matter of one school year,so allowing students to do some classes online will make it easier for more students to graduate.

The idea of online classes might sound difficult for some students because they tend to learn better face to face. Schools can offer virtual teaching lessons for those who have an issue with attending all their classes at school and learn better by someone verbally explaining each concept to them. Not all students have computers at home which is understanding, in order for students to complete online classes from home they will need a computer,schools can offer students a borrowed computer or laptop in order for them to participate in online classes. Schools can Introduce a system where they provide for those who need the help of obtaining a computer and to still be able to do their classes from home. By providing for those who need the computers, students will not be held back from the idea of doing classes from home just because they dont own a computer.

Having the choice of doing classes from home can be very beneficial to students. This gives students the opportunity to complete more classes and actually do them without having the excuse of being absent to school. Given the chance of doing classes from home can increase the passing levels for more classes. The idea of doing classes from home can be helpful for students who need it, and encourage students who need the option of at home classes to actually get these classes done from home. I think all schools should have an option that allows students to do classes from home.        ",4.0
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attent classes from home?

on my opinion students would not like the idea of taking more time to study, because nowdays students are very busy, stressed, and tired of school, they would not like to have to hear more stuff that has to do with school . besides some people are more smart and they could take the class just to see how thats going to help, but sometimes people dont try the stuff and thats why, they never know if they are going to like it or not.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students from home by way of online video conferencing

I think, students are not going to have any benefit to attent classes from home. some of the studends have to work, do stuff at home, or stay in school on other activities. students sometimes, actually need some help with some classes but they might not like to be taking the classes at home, The studend taking the class at home could get distracted by so many things at his house. While some other studends that have better grades and like school they could take the class, but they also will have homework and things to do at home.

Students would not get any benefits by taking classes at home because, the online class could be also start teaching the same work that the teacher already teach you, or either the online class could be teaching different ways how to solve a problem that the student will get very stressed and after that its not going to be able to learn something from it and instead helping the student the online class is going to make it more difficult.",3.0
all tho some people say online classes is good. they have their reasons. Tacking online classes i good it has it's bad. if you take online classes you can stay home and dont you don't have to go to a school building and you don't have to wake up early and go to school and you wouldn have to go to school and see people you dont want to see and you dont have to eat the school lunch you can eat whatever you want to eat when ever you want to eat and you wouldnt have to follow and rule you can make you one rolls and it would be esyer to take a test when you online classes cuz you can look things up on the internet and pass you test but when you you in school you have wake up early and get ready to go on the buss and you have to go to your classes on time and then you have to sit in a small class and sit in a desk and do your school work and you have to follow rule like you would have to go to your classes on time and if you do make it to class on time then you would have to go to the tarty table and if you keep doing it you would happen more then three times you would have to go to iss and what iss is you would sit in this quit room with out your phone and and you cant talk anyone. and is you dont go to class at all they will find you and put you in iis and they will call you mom or dad or email your mom or dad telling them that you wasnt in school and i dont know about you but my parents would get mad that i wasnt in school when they saw me go to school in the morning. And when you disrespect your teacher they will call security on you and they will come and get you and tall to you. And if you get in a fight with a student then you will be in a big trouble the security will come and get you and it its really bad they will call an ambles and this time the principle and the police and parents will get involved and the other person parents might press charges and that would not be good for you on your reared beauty when you apply for coleg they will see that you had a bad history and they wont want that tiyp of beaver in their school so you would be hurting your fucher. And if you do or take drugs or sell drugs in school then you would be in soo much trouble with the school and with the police and you parents and you could go well if your eithing and older and if your danger then that you would go to jive. and you would probably be kicked out of school and you would have to go to a new school and love all your friends and you wound have the same friends in the same school as you and that would be so sad and you wound have to go to jell and earthing so i think it beter to go to the online classes not that i get to eat all i want but becuth it a lot going on in schools that you have to go thour and you mith not like it i think it would be a good exprmnt to try online classes ,2.5
"Schools that provides distance learning as an option to attend classes from home online, or video conferencing are few of all the country. It is a good idea for all students that wants to graduate, even if they don't have time to go to school every day.

Students some times don't have time to go to school every day, some of them works in a part time jobs; That's difficult to them because, they need to wake up earlier to go to school and do homework in the afternoon.

Some students decided not go to school any more because, they need to work to pay bills, and help their families in home. Also, with this option students can be relaxing in their homes and studying at the same time. Another example why this is a good option for students is because some of them need classes to graduate, and they can not get that classes done by the school year, but if they have the possibility to take classes online they can finish during the year.

However, this beneficial option is good for those students that are not eligible anymore to attend school because of their ages. There is a final age that students can be accepted by the school, and if they had more than the age the school said, they can not attend to school anymore, even if they want to continue going to school and graduate. That's why online classes from home is great idea for those students who wants the diplomat.

In conclusion this option is beneficial for all students that want to study and do other jobs in the same time. Those who work and wants to finish school, are benefit with this amazing idea that some schools provide. The're just few schools that students can assist for those who want to get their diplomas done with facility way to study. Is a really helpful option for all students in all the country.",4.0
"I think students would benefit doing school at home many kids maybe going through problems at home and could just be tired or maybe just annoyed of to much problems. Students working from home is good for kids that could be getting buliud either they speack up but dont see a change, having problems with adults here at school that don't really help much but just bring the student down, or maybe just being an anti socicl person. Online school is something really seroius to look into if tyour dealing with problems at home having so much stress in you and cant deal with more stress of school, or you just simply need to work to help out your family it could be a chance they need money but cant get enough to get bills paid and need help in paying them,maybe you dont really have time in showing up to school. I think online school is a good choice for many students that could have problems at school and not seeing a change. Students wouldn't have to get up so early in the morning having to look presentable or anything just having to have a good schealue that works good for both work and school. Both online work or video conferencing are good for kids that have their ways in learning like as in having videos chat with a teachers. Students can be fast learners just by reading insturstions they got it memorized and having the work ready in less than an hour. Others students are more to a visiual learners that have to see work getting it explaned to many time for them to undersatnd the work some students are slower than others. Online school would be the best choice to many students that just have it the ruff way and not easy. Other reason is because many kids get sick really easliy and its better to keep those kids away from others in getting sick. Online schools can really make a big change in kids that are just not ready have more stress in them and wouldnt have to deal with more problems with parents or maybe getting bullied. Oline schools would make a big change in those kids lifes in a positive way. ",3.0
"Online schools is a good idea but not for everybody, some people do good being home schooled but some just cant do it. Online class are not easy not anybody can pass thats why they not meant for everyone. Being home schooled is nothing like regular school you don't have to wake early, you get to choose what time you do your work.

Not having to wake up early everyday is nice but knowing you have to get something done right after you start is not fun and specially if you not getting the help you need not being able to ask the questions you have makes it a lot harder,

you also have to try and do your best because if you fail you can't talk to your teacher about helping you make it up and helping you pass it like regular school.

If you are home schooled you missing out the fun in regular schools not talking about class meaning all the fights, all the fire drills, all the dances and friends sometimes having trouble in regular school i always tell myself i need to drop out or take online classes but home schooled is not just for everybody and probably at least 60% of home schooled students either don't finish or go back to regular school.

ragular school is better then home schooled or online you have better chance of passing if you work with other people and get help and give help because in life we get what we give. trying your best at anything is all that matters not giving up keep trying one day you going to make it .",3.0
"Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. Other school don't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because that's not great way to learn.

Desagree:. Other school don't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because that's not great way to learn.

1: Students wouldn't benefit being able to attend classes from home because if they don't understand something who can help them.

2: Distance learning is not the best way to learn because you need some school to learn what you need to know like student that you are.

3: If you take classes from home you can learn but if you take the classes direcly from some school thatone is the best way that you to learn.

Other school don't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because that's not great way to learn because students wouldn't benefit being able to attend classes from home because if they don't understand something who can help them, distance learning is not the best way to learn because you need some school to learn what you need to know like student that you are and If you take classes from home you can learn but if you take the classes direcly from some school thatone is the best way that you to learn.

Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing because for some students that's the best way to take their classes but for other student is not the best way because some student have to work after school and they have other responsabilities to do like the people who came to this country from another country and don't live with their parents this guys have to work and study at the time so that's why I think is not benefit to attend classes at home. For example the people who came to this country, they came for a better future, better opportunities and they need to learn a new languaje and that's not easy for everybady some people learn very quickly but other people not.

calsses by way online that's great for some student because they have a great idea and reasons to take classes from home for example some student have child and they have to care about their baby's so they can't go to school for them that's a great opportunuty to study and do what they want, this people just need motivation to keep going and they can gain their goals.

I think students they don't be benefit attend classes from home because at home they have too many things that can be disctracte for them with things like electronic devices, or persons like childrens, and any other distract thing.

Video conferencing that's good form to learn for some people who want to attend classes from home but if you have any question or any dude you can't ask to this video that's why I thing that the best way to learn is going to school and work hard every day to do and study what we want to do in the future, we have our future in our hand if we do any bad thing some day we pay for that, always we have to think and be sure for what we want and do. in this life everything the we do to somebody good or but someday that thing comeback to you and there woud you feel what other people someday fool for your foult.

The old people who have esperience in life they said to students keep going ''if you want you can...''",2.5
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools goal is to offer for students classes from home to make sure students do their best in order to pass and graduate. Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students love the idea of taking their courses at home, will have more time to do any activities they could not do in school day time, and its more easier.

First, students love the idea of taking classes at home because students do not have to wake up early for school, that give students more time to sleep and all of us know how important to get your daily hour sleep on our brains. Also, it's good for students who are shy for what ever reasons. I know someone who took classes at home for third and fourth quarters, so he didn't have to go to school. The classes he took started at six PM every Monday and Wednesday. This guy told me that online classes were helpful for him and made him pass.

Second, students will have more time to do any activities. Schools started at eight AM and ends at three PM. At this time, students could do any thing like working in the morning time or help parents in anything or do anything else. Students could use this seven hours to do anything that may help them in the future. As I said before, online classes start at six PM and ends at eight PM. Generic_Name, my closest friend, took classes at home, so he could work and get money.

Students take classes at home at home because it's more easier. Many students said that is better to take our classes at home because it's more easier and teachers teach in really simple way that make anyone understand than what school do. Students wants to pass so they takes the easy way that the school offer to pass, and as I said before, schools offer distance learning to make students succeed. Generic_Name, one of my best friends, took online classes, and he told me that's his teacher was really good because of the way that the teacher taught them back then, makes everything easier and simple that even a kid could understand it.

Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home not just because it's easy or can attend it from home. Schools goal is to make sure we succeed on this classes, and that's what schools here for. Is to open the way for us to create the future because if students are 20% of our present, they are 100% of our future. Some people or students do not like the idea of taking classes from home and will disagree with me. After all everyone have his own way of thinking and living. So what do you think of taking classes at home?",4.0
"Schools offer distant learning as an option for student's who likes work from home, can there be good or bad benefits from working at home?. I think that working at home would not benefit student's, reason being home is more comfortable and relaxing .Working at a public school can help you get opportunity's with friend's or teacher's like a job or college career. Public school is more efficient because, other students can help you out on work and at home no one is there to ask for help. Talking to a teacher in person can be so much more helpful then on a computer . Staying after school is a big benefit to people who prefer public school because you can get work done that is needed, but at home I feel like you can't get the same help you need on the work.

Working from home can have its benefits like being with family more often. Working from home can be challenging for some people because home is more comfortable therefore the student would become more lazy and get bad grades. One thing about working at home is you would make your own schedule which could be flexible to your own time. Students who work at home would have no one to help them out with work outside of class which would be hard on the student

Students who go to public schools will benefit more then the students that work at home. Public schools bring more opportunity's as distant learning would not get as many . This issue could be solved depending on the student, some students like to be at home and some like to go to public schools . Public schools help student's with college information and helps the student choose his path in life. Working in a public school environment, helps more students do better in there classes makes them more productive. ",3.5
"I think students doing home assignments will not benefit the student, because it doesn't help the student grasp the same kind of concepts like other students that do go to school.

The reason why I personally don't like home schooling is because if I'm at home I wouldn't get my work done. I'd be distracted by looking at my dog and looking at what my mom would be doing. Another reason why I would not like it is because I'm not getting the same kind of education like most of the other students. I wouldn't have the chance to learn with my classmates or go on trips to historical monuments and historical musuems with them. When you're home schooled you're mostly self-taught.

One other reason why I wouldn't reccommend home schooling is because you're not interacting with other students which can cause depression and anxiety. Another reason why home schooling is not such a great idea is because when he learns how to write and read and play a musical instrument and masters soccer, running, or other sports in general how will this particular student learn how to communicate to the real world if the parent has kind of isolated him from meeting people. One of the other reasons why home schooling is bad is because the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children. Some parent may be too overbearing or impatient, which may cause the child to react in a negative manner.

I think home schooling is a bad idea is because he wouldn't get the proper education like most students in school. That could possibly effect the student and also that student is not interacting with other students which could lead to depression and axiety. If the parent loses their patience the child would start to act up on them. For all of these reasons home schooling is not a good idea. ",3.5
"Yes i think the students are benefit because they don't need come to schol just what they have to use is a cumputer. and i think is more better because you can do more thinks in you home you can help you family. and you have time to work and you can study in the same time. and they can make money because after you done with the high schhol if you want to continue in the university. and you have money you can continue. and if you come to school you have time to work. and if you study from you home you have time to study and so more think. Because a lot of people don't came to school because they need money to buy food and pay his rent because they don't take help from his family. For my example i came to school because my family help me but a lot of people from others country came to this country and they don't have family here so they wanna study but they wanna help his family and his county and if a lot of school have the program what you can take class from you home i think is more better because you can do a lot of thinks for example i know a lot of people they wanna study but they need to work so they say they can't study and work in the same time so they have to take one of two option so they have to pick one and they say they wanna work because if they go to school they can't make money and if they work they can buy his food and they can pay the rent for example i have one cousin he was in school and he need just one year to graduate but when he was in schhol his mom said he need to work because she don't wanna pay his rent anymore and he leave the school and he dedicated just to work because he need pay his rent and if school have the program he can work and he can study too that one is to sad because he ned just one more year to graduated and he don't graduated because he need pay his rent tha's want i think is a lot of school have the program they help a lot of guys

Here is one more example a lot of people live in mountains and the bus don't go so they don't have transportaion so they don't come to school that is sad because maybe they wanna study and they can't come. i know people in west virginia. they don. t go school because the school is like 1 hours and they don't have transportation. and if all the school in united state have the program they can help a lot of familys and they cxan open a lot of doors for the people.

Here is another example i have one friend. He come to school just one or two days per week. Because he need to work. Because he said he have to work because he don't have money for buy food and pay rent in the same time that is sad because he said i want to graduated but i can't because i havde to work for pay my rent and buy my thinks. and if schools have the program they can help him to do his gol.

I meet one friend in walmart last week i play for soccer team in Generic_City . and i was with my short that say barsity in the from of the short. and the guy said hey in think i know you and i said where you saw me. and he said in Generic_City and. He ask me if i'm in Generic_City now and i said yes and you and said i'm not in school anymore. and i said why and he said because inmigration took my parents and they send to my country and i'm alone in this country so i need to work for pay a lot of think. and he said i wanna study but i can't because i can't do two thinks in the same time. and said my gol is work with police and i said hey wanna you don't study in the day and work in the night and he said i can't because i have to help my parents in honduras because id i don't send money to then they can buy food.

my mom maybe love if i take class onlines because she work all day. if i take class online and can help her to do thinks in my home because she go to work in the morning at 7 am and she came back at 5 pm and the end she go to the part time and she come back at 11:45 pm and if i take class online i can wok too and i can help her with think in the home and money to pay a rent she is to old.

There are some kids that don't go to school, having the schhol next to thenm, but there is alot of people out here that are thing to go to school or at less take onlne classes but they can't because they have to wotk some of the people even have two jobs.",2.5
"some peole believe distance learning is a good opcion for students, because they can be at home, and they can take the classes they need and with this opcion they are able to do others activities, they need to do everyday.

for example, students who don't have the enought of money and they need to work.

this show that many students get benefits from this opcion that school give to students, because students can work by the day and take the class by the night.

in another example we have students that for any reason can not attend to school.

they could stay at home and also get the credits they need to graduate from schoool.

this opcion is also good for the students who want to graduate early from school. for example, students that only want to be by 3 years at school, they can take the regular classes and also can take some classes as distance learning. this suggest that every schools should have this program, because it is so helpfuly for students who want to graduate from school, but they can't attend school.

online classes also help people who already finish the school, but they want to continue studing and they can take clases online. for example a teacher who have a basic degree to teach, but he want to get a master degree. he or she can teach by the they, and he can take his classes online, when he get free time.

in conclusion this opcion is very helpfuly for students , and it is a opcion wich all the schools should have.",2.5
"I don't believe the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. First of all, the research showing there is a lot of chance to know about the distance. It's hard to make the online or video to offer the distance. Because when the students are in online or when they try to make video they are not going to take care them self. For example: I remember when I was six grade my friend PROPER_NAME was making online video. We went to classes from home to know how far it is. On that time she just focus on her video she wasn't focus on her way. After that, she try to cross the way but she still making video. She didn't saw the car she try to cross the road. So,she got some accident because of the video and she just focusing what she is doing.

The most important way is to offer the distance classes from home is using map. It's easy to know how far or how close it is. Other ways, the students have to take care there self when they are in the way because there is a lot of car.

Additional, there are not going to take care them self when they are making online or video. They just focus what there are doing. For example: when I was tine grade I remember my friend PROPER_NAME she was eleven grade.

She try to offer the distance for her friend by making video. When She was school from home. Then, she started showing the way. On that time, she wasn't take care her self because she was focusing the video.

Next, she try to cross the way by raining. She didn't pay attention the way and she got car accident. On that time she passed away she died. I agree some students think they would benefits from being able to attend classes from home. But most of them are not going to take care them self because there are not focusing the way. They just focusing what there are doing or they just focusing online or video. Additional, using map is butter than making online or video. Other ways its hard to make online or video for offer the distance. Most students are not going to focus when there are making that.

In conclusion, I don't believe the students would benefits by way of online or video to offer the distance. There is other way to offer the distance from classes to home.",2.5
"_Yes i think yes its can by a benefit to attend classes from home because many students come late in the school and the teachers sometimes they mark they students are absents or late, but may the school can give the opportunity to who work or to who need it because many student we are working in at the night and sometimes we see many of they students sleep in classes.

_But if we attend classes from home that will by better because we will sleep more time at home and we will don't come at the school every day or wake up the same time all day, but the teachers will by attent for their students who has take their classes from home to send their work or to help they students when they don't understand or sometimes we stock to do or how to do and then the teachers will by help.

_But is a bad idea to because many students are may don't wants to doing all they work at home because they knowing they are home and when we are home we prefer doing others things except the school work and that can by a problem when we take the test because many students can fail their test, because in home we can find the answers in internet or anywhere but when we are in the school every day we can't use our phone or anything to find the answers because the teachers wants to test us what are we know or what we are need to know to by better and to resolve all you'r work in you'r own idea may the teaher can give you some ideas or examples or explain how you can do it but is diferent like when you finding the answer in internet because the internet can give you all the answer and yuo will be no learn nothing because it's just copy what are you see except with the teachers you learn more because they tell to you to try to do it in your own and you have an idea to what are you going to do.

_And it can by hard for the students to graduate because can affect they attend in the school and will many students going to skiping because they can come in the school but they can leave early because they can find a excuse to to leave and to do the attendece at home or just skiping classes and don't doing nothing. Well it okay to come in the school every day because if one has attend in home then all students wasts to have attend at home ",3.0
"Student who live far or have a hard time learning will not help them succeed with there classes Teachers are feeling worried about there Student and they try everything to help. So the Teacher report to the Principal and notice the score are very low. They have to find a way to make there student successful, so they had a meeting and suggest that Student should do there assignment at home they called Home School.

Home school is a program to allow Student to do there homework, quizzes, assignments, and tests. This program help the Student to become successful, Student give there thought about home school and they say is more easy then School. What good about home School that you can stay at Home, eat your lunch watch T.V, and you will still have time to do your assignment on time.

But some other Student didn't want to be home school because they feel them self bored in home. They don't get to make friends, they need help with their assignments, They won't get the information they need. Student often get Home School because they probably don't have schools in there location but Parents want the best for there kids to have a good education so they gotta do whatever it takes to have there kids to become successful in the future.

If I was in the position or suggestion on the issue I would let the Student know to should take regular school. Because you will have better chances to succeed better then home school you will still have your friend in fact they can even help you with your assignments, even better chances to get to college with Teacher help you will know more information to be ready in the future. Student still suggest to be in Home School Because is still a good program to in to help be successful but not in the future People should take School more seriously if they want the better chance.",3.0
"students who take an online classes do not have much benefits because, they feel lazy to study on their own, sometimes do not their assignments and also do not have people they will be compete with. They also do not have much confident to speak with lots of people or give a speech in front of many people, which makes someone who attends an everyday class with a lot of people to be experienced than a person who takes an online class. people with much experience in a lot of things do not always have fake people in their lives.

People always think that taking an online class is very good, which is totally wrong. When taking online classes you do not get to know the people who are performing much better than you in class, but when you go to an everyday class in a school, you know the people who are better than you in different subjects. When you take an online class you do not get people who will help you solve your problems in much courses; for example, when you take an online class and you fail in a subject you would not know those who performed good in that subject, that means that you will not know how to study hard to perform good next time. Online students always find it difficult to study because, they do not see their mates in school learning which will also encourage them to that same thing. This means that taking an online classes will not be advisable for students.

Also when taking an online class, you do not get to interact with different kind of people through out the world. People who take an online class do not always have the confident to speak in public and do not always have lot of friends. Having friends is one of the important things in our life. When you have friends you share each others problems and solve it together. This means that when you take an online class you do not always have enough friends to speak to or to share your problems with. For instance,when you are given the opportunity to give a speech in front of a lot of people, you begin to shiver or start stammering because you are not use to speaking in public. but when a person who attends classes which involves a lot of individuals, they always have the confident not to only speak in front of their mates but to also speak to those who are much older than them without any fears.

Moreover, people who always involve themselves in a video conference do not always know the people their dealing with in their business or do not always have much idea about their business meeting. When one is present at work place all the time, he or she runs the business smoothly without any misunderstanding with anybody. Again when having a business with someone on a video conference, you do not know if the person you are dealing with is a fraud a fraud or not. So people who do an online businesses always end up putting themselves into trouble. When one is always present at their business places, they always know the people who are hard working and can make the business go much further and those who are lazy. When you are always at your work place,you make your members to respect and adopt your policies.

People who take online classes do not understand much better because, the teacher is not always around them when they need help with the topic that they not understand. But hen you are in an everyday school classes, when a teacher always teach and you do not understand you always know where to locate him to ask for help. Even when the teacher is not around, you can find different teachers who also teaches that subject and they will always find a solution to your problem. So students who attend an everyday classes perform much better than those who take an online classes.

All the above mentioned, which includes, it makes them interact with different people, find a lot of friends, get to know good people in a business, ask teachers for help when they have a problem really shows that taking an online class or a video conference is not really beneficial for an individual. Once all these measures are taken into consideration, people will see that going to an everyday class or making yourself present at a business meeting is more important to a person.",4.0

"some school offer distance learning as an option from students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. and my opinion the student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home; the student have more freedom of concentrate in the home, student have problem for go to the school or the is student is sick of a illness and have more responsibility in the school or classes, home and job.

First, the student have more freedom of concentrate in the home that school because student not have noisy peoples, student work more quickly and have interests in the class. The corporation a student of regular school and home student, in the regular school have lass time in the class and home have more time and focus in the class.

Second, some student cannot go to the school for problem in the health or is sick of a illness. Today al the peoples can student and learn for class online or video conferencing, student with problem can learn and study like other student from regular school.

Finally, other people have responsibility in the class like the job because some not have time for go to the school and work all the day and only have time after work in the night. The person can study all the night for online or video conferencing. The principal parts of the online is you can study any day or time.

in conclusion the student can take class for online or video conferencing in the home because today the technology have a good benefit in the peoples. student can study and learn in the home in any moment or day, have more concentration, focus, responsibility and the person have problem of health can study and learn of your home.

"I don't think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because when students coming home, they need to do the homework first. Maybe that's day some people have a lot of homework so they couldn't attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If they could open some video of online then I think some students can''t watching whole video. Because when I finish my homework, I feeling so tired and I just want go to my bedroom or play game, message, Facebook, ... I guess that's habit all students because almost students doesn't wanna be work too much and parent will be for son or daughter spend time for favorite like soccer, bamboo, ukulele, ... If the students might relaxing then I think they will learning better and faster.

Some parent want my son or daughter go to the bedroom early. Because parent can control them easy, example like some students will say I still do home work on the Laptop, but they playing game with friends. The best way is for students go to sleep early. If your might for students sleep early, It really good for eyes and healthy because one young people can sleeping enough eight our every night, you can feel comfortable for star learning better new day. And if you don't sleeping enough, you can't learning anything at school because you always sleeping in classes and teachers always say ''wake up, wake up''. It not good for you and teachers. And when you go home, time for sleep but you don't feel sleep because you sleeping in classes too much. That's why you don't feel want to sleep, and today to tomorrow to whole life, you still don't want to sleep early. Maybe that will be become the cycle in your bad life, If you don't wanna change your style.

I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is not good. Because when parents coming home, they need talking, do something or have a dinner with family. It's will be better you do a lot homework. If you have dinner every night, you will have a lot of conversation with your wife or daughter, Since you will be know what your family want and your sentiment with family will be better and better.

When students learning online or video at home, maybe they don't understand what video say and if they have a question, what teachers they will ask ? And if everybody have a question to asked teachers, the teachers can't responded the question too much for students. If students waiting for tomorrow go to school, maybe students will be forgot the question they want ask right now.

I think students need learning at school better learning at home. Because one people one idea, that's mean have a lot of answers your guess and you will be know the best the answers from teacher. It'll be helping you how to do work team. Work team so important with students because in your future, labor need you know how to work together. If you know how to work, you will be become the manager or boss. If I work with teachers, maybe I will better for my way.",3.0

some people need to try new things, becase if we no try new things we can not know to leave they try, because the life its feat of new experiment.",2.0
"Some people say that students are better off attending classes online, mostly because they can feel a sense of comfort and no worries of school tardiness. I say that it's better to not attend distant classes and attend them from the school itself.

Students are better off attending classes from the actual school because students tend to have more concentration while actually attending the class. When attending the class from home, students will be more concentrated on their home atmosphere, or what happens at home. Concentrating onto something usually comes from the atmosphere you are in. Attend your classes are better and more effective when the person is alerted or more attentive to their classes or courses.

Moreover, students will develop social communication when interacting with other students. Social communication is important because not only will you get to know the other person's side of knowledge, but you can get experience from the other person that could benefit or impact your way of making desicions in your life. Students will be more of an introvert if attend classes from home or distant classes. In this way, students will definitely develop working skills when they start having a job as an older person.

However, even if they won't be able to go through or worry about tardiness if taking distant classes, going to school knowing that there is tardiness, will prepare them for the future when running to work and making it on time. Making to school or work on time depends on how the individual is smart enough to manage their own time wisely.

In conclusion, the more preferable method for students is coming to school or the class session wherever it's taking place. In this way, students develop better communication, better concentration and develop time management. Students will become better individuals. ",4.0
"A topic that is debated is if students should do online classes. Some people believe that there should be online classes. They believe that there should be online classes because the students can take there time and feel comfortable where they are . I belive that we shouldn't have online classes because student can ask for help when they need it, Students are better when they work together as a team and you can get extra help after school and before school .

Students can ask for help. Teacher can help students when they don't understand something instead of trying to look it up on the internet .Students don't learn from the internet or they will just forget. Online classes is good but what if the students doesn't understand then they would just stay confused. The teacher can show them in person then in a computer screen. If students did online classes what if they don't understand there work because they can't just call there teacher sometimes they don't answer.

Students work better when they work together. Group projects can help them in the future when they got to work with other people. They can learn from each other and there mistakes . When the students are in groups they don't do it solo and they can get the more work done. They get to meet new people that they never ever get to talk to and make new friends. Online classes you just listen to the teacher and ask question do the same thing but can never work with other people.

There extra help after and before school. Online classes there no before or after school it just the time of your classes. In School the teacher stay after or come before school to help students with their work or the ones that just doesn't understand . The Teacher helps them with homework so they don't have to do it at home and the same with classwork if they don't get it done there after school. There also people who have to do stuff after school so there is before school where they can come early and do there workk.

I believe that we shouln't have Online classes because student can ask question,student have more fun doing group activity and if the students need help they have after and before school to get extra help.

Online classes isn't really necessary it wouldn't effect anything.

Teacher are more helpful then computer.                                         ",3.0

However some students work to help with pay the rent, pay bills I know some students that would like to attend to school, but the do not have the opportunity for some reason .For example does not have enough time, or falling sleep every time that try to weak up to go to school is not easy work and study every day that is brave.

The idea here is to support teenagers to prepare for the future

someone will be the next president of the United States, or a professional doctor that will help many people from many countries.We can help our teenagers for a better future as school is our responsibility to work with them.

Should have the opportunity to attend classes from home and work as the same time to help their parents and the most important prepare for the future. ",3.0
"Over ten precent of the students say that they would rather go to school instead of staying home. It would benefit the students learning abilites because some teachers will teach differently then other teachers. It is so much easier learning at school because the teachers at school know what the students needs to learn. The students needs someone who knows how to teach and has been teaching for a while. If the students pick online learnig the teachers can be fake a pretend to teach the kids when they do not know anything. The video conferencing can get messed up by the internet because some people might have slow connection or no connection at all.

It would be easier for students because they will learn more at school then the video chat, or from online. Some students have a slower learning abilities then others. The students are learning by one teacher from the video chat some students will be done much quicker then the other students. At school th teachers wait for the other students finish then they let the rest of class to do other work. It will not help the students to learn from home because at home is where they have their games tv all of that stuff they will pretend to be doing work, but actually they will be doing other adn stuff and they will tell the teachers that they already finished the work.

Students needs someone who has a degree in teaching. It will be easier for the teachers because they will know what things they have to teach to the certain type of students. They would know how to teach it to them and it will be easier for them to learn the topic. It is easier to go to school becuase we will learn the topic with other students and students can ask for help from their friends or the the teachers in class.

The teachers on video chat can be a random person off the streets and teach the student the wrong infomation. Also it will cost a lot of money for the students learn from a video chat. Schools are free, so the students can go there and get education for free, nor the students, or parents have to pay. Some parents, nor students can afford online classes because it costs like over one hundred dollars.

Staying home and doing online classes is fun because we are able to stay in our night clothes and do school work. Students can get their blankets and anything they want and do work while being comfortable. The students do not have to get up and go to school. They can get up at anytime and do class work. As fun as that sounds some students will not be able to meet their friends because their friends might have a different sechdules then their other friends. They will have to do work wilhile they want to meet up.

Students should not do online classes because it will intefere with their other stuff like hanging out with friends and going to work. They will miss out on parties that their friends will host for them. It help the students and the teachers because not everyone has a good ability like the other students. ",3.5
"Although some say students wouldn't benefit attending classes from home because students will not have the opportunity to work in groups with other students, actually students would benefit attending classes from home because they will feel comfortable and students can be more safe.

Those who believed not being able to attend classes fom home wouldn't benefit students because they can't work with other students. Around 200 articles said that students that attend online classes don't have the best projects just because they can't have other student's opinion. For example, so many different ideas by having a group can be more interesting than only having a person's ideas.

However, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can feel comfortable. Furthermore, a school survey showed that students prefer online clases because that makes them feel comfortable just to be seated inappropriate. I agree with these people because I like to be seated in many ways, but in school rules is only a way to be seated.

Also, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can be more safe. Lately, more than hundred school shootings had happened, so it show us being at school can be dangerous. Other big danger can be gangs at school they can be an influence with so many bad things on a child's life.

In my opinion being able to attend classes at home can make parents happy; they don't have to be worried for their child's safety.

As you can see students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students can't stay connect with other students, actually being able to attend classes from home would make students feel comfortable and secure. ",2.5
"Does students think that learning from home would be helpful for them? Learning from home won't be as helpful as much as you go to school and learn in the class from teacher. I don't think that students would learn anything from video or online conference because if they don't learn anything while their at school, so how would they learn from home. They might have work at home or at outside, which makes them distracted or disturbed them from their work, and they might have problems with it. Every student has the right to make their decision but this idea won't work out.

Mostly, in every home there is problem which we don't want to share with anyone or we don't want anyone to know about what is happening in our home. Like fighting with mom, brother or father anyone in home or we might don't want anyone to know why are fighting. I mean people have privacy in their life or difficulties which they don't want to share with anyone, and even if they do the work from home it might not help as much as we are in school.

Commonly, every student is not equally intelligent so they can understand one thing in one time. Most of the time and most student take a long time to understand one thing in this situation if they decide to put distance learning then those student might not understand clearly and of course they won't come to school, so they can have a day off.

I mean if a student can't learn something from school how could he or she learn from home.

However, every student want to learn more and achieve something and most of them don't even care. The person who want to achieve something always try their best to do it, but the person don't care would get a chance to not learn. I mean everyone want to relax in home because school work are really tough, but even after that every student try their best to learn and distance learning can't help it out. if you are out somewhere and you're teacher is trying to teach you in online you might not get what they are saying.

However, some people might think that distance learning might help them but if they can't learn in school then how will they learn when they are not in school. I don't think if you are far away from school so you can learn anything from that. Anyway I don't think that students or the teacher might have that time to talk to every student or teacher to ask question or answer them. One teacher can handle a class together, but same teacher can't handle every student differently, so I don't think that this idea would work.",3.5
"As a student myself, I think students would benefit from attending classes from home, because attending classes can help students manage their own time and learn how to self control, and can follow their own pace of learning.

As day by day passes, I believe that lots of students are sick of repeating the same dull sketchual, and wish they could stay at home for school, on the other hand, they will not have to wake up so early everyday when they worked on their homework till so late. When students attend classes from home, they will be able to manage their own sketchual, learn how to control their time efficiently, be more self-reliance, and prepare for the future.

In conclusion, it is a benefit for students to attend classes from home, because they can learn how to make their own plan, and learn how to manage time, which I believe that it will help the students a lot in their jobs, future life goals or even their entire life.",4.5
"Working From Home

Should students be allowed to attend classes from home? I agree that attending classes while at home would be beneficial for many people and can actually help them work better. One reason is that it would be less stressful for the student and put a lot less pressure into getting the work done. Another reason is that it would give them more time to work, for example they could relax and take little breaks while working instead of having to cram all that work into one class session. My last reason is that it would help improve grades. If a student is allowed to work while being at home, it would allow their brain time to think more about their work and how they can improve it.

Attending classes from home would be less stressful and put a lot less pressure on the student. For example, one class session is an hour and thirty minutes. Teachers give a lot of work to students and expect them to get it done without any problem, but the problem is they can't because being forced to do a lot of work is not very fun and with very limited time can put a lot of stress on the teenage brain and also damage their mental health. Expectations now a days are really high for students but their mental health and state aren't taken into consideration.

Time is of the essence. Students need time to get their work done and whatever they aren't able to complete becomes homework. Having to do a lot of work without being able to take a break can really suck. Imagine if you had to do a bunch of work without being able to take a rest because whatever you don't complete you're gonna have to complete at home. If students could work from home, they'd have all the time they need to get their work done and they could take a break if they got too tired. At home students wouldn't have to worry about time because they could complete the work at their own pace.

Grades are important, and when a student gets a bad grade, it isn't exactly the best look. Working from home would allow students more time to think about their work, when in a classroom students can't spend a lot of time thinking because they don't have much time. On the other hand, being at home would give them all the time they could possibly need to complete their work and how they could improve it for a better grade. If students could improve their work they would get better grades, and there's no better place to do that then home, the place you're most comfortable with.

To sum it all up, students should be allowed to attend classes from home because it causes less stress and pressure which is better for their mental health, gives them more time to think and do their work, and helps improve their grades while in a place they're more comfortable with.",5.0
"Should students take online classes? Students can learn more by taking online classes? students have benefits for attend classes from home?.

On this paper I will argue about how students have benefits attend classes from home, and how improves skills for he future.

I think that students would have benefits for attend classes from home, because is a new opportunity for study more, and for improve more the skills more online classes for the future.

Teenagers that are attend classes from home I think will be more healthy, because that means that students will be more able to sleep , and will be have more time to rest the brain, and more time to do all the things at home, because a lot of students they do not sleep during the night the reason, because they work others that always talks with a friends and others that they use technology, and waking up at the early morning make the students brain tired, and makes the students do nothing at school for the rest of the day.

Students will be more organizing there time meaning that students will be able to have more time to have job, or do others activities during the day, or after taking classes online, because when they attend to school they do not manege very good the time they always doesn't care about time or do something important.

Students will be putting more attention to classes, because when teenagers attend to school most of the things that distract the students are the friends and the technology means that teenagers when are around friends distract the mind out of the class, and that causes that students don't pass the class, or the test, otherwise when are taking classes from home there is no body around that can distract and loss the attention of the students and will be more easy to do homework, projects, and study for test.

Some people say that the idea of students attend classes online from home will have more benefits is a bad idea, because they say,""Teenagers are lazy, and they will sleep more late at night"".

Students taken classes online will be more smart, because there will more practice skills for the future where will be benefits of know how classes are doing online, and they where taking.

On the future students will be able to attend classes from home, and will have benefits for skills, and this will make the teachers more easy to turn any work or practice any class that they missed, and that way students can have more ideas how will things will change and compare between attend to school and take classed online.",3.0
"When we talk about technology and ways to improve our life, What is the first think that come to our minds: Cell phones, computers, internet etc. However technology is also present in the field of the medicine, food daily life etc. Now you think that technology is Just cell phones computers and internet.

I'am pretty sure that student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I was a clear example of this situation, last year I take an online course and of course it benefit my self a lot. How I get benefit: well first I pass the class that I was needing. It makes you feel more comfortable, because you're attending to class from home. It is more flexible, what I means with flexible you have more time to work in other things, also you have the option to turn in the homework a little later, one last thing you administer you time whatever you like.

Student would get benefits in many ways. If they study from home and if they also go to the normal school they can graduate much early than the usual. They can find a job too, if they organize their time wisely. If they have a job so they could earn money and they can use to pay college.

If some student ask me I obviously recommend them to take online classes, it is a good way to improve your weakness and also you are going to be more success.

My conclusion is yes student get benefits in many ways when they take classes from home. and I think that every school should have the option to choose if the students wants to take online classes, and also is a good idea to help the student to be more success in the life.

"Is distance learning such as, online learning or video conferencing more benefical than traditional learning?. In my opinion, I believe that most students that take online classes have a higher risk of failing. Therefore, they have a higher change of getting distracted. Studies confirmed that young adults are more likely to get distracted than adults since, their minds are not fully develop. I also believe that, every human being has a different way of learning and goes on their own pace.

There is positive's and negaitive's reasons about person-to-person learning and online learning. Person-to-Person learning helps the students gain more knowledge and interaction. While being in a traditional classes, you can ask questions anytime and gain a relationship with one another. The negaitives of tradtional learning is that, students attend to skip class, not listen to the teacher, and sleep during teaching. Students attend to do these negative actions because they might be force to go to school or they can not go on their own pace.

Online classes are not benefical but you can go on your own pace. Another reason is that, techonolgy is popular in this generation that students rather be in a device. Online classes have a positive side to them because there is many options online in what you want to learn about, but keep in mind that visual is harder than interacting. Visual is diffcult to understand because there is no instuctor or a teacher helping you in person. I believe that everybody is different and we all learn in different ways and different pace.

Some Students would not be able to attend at home classes because of personal problems such as, not having food to feed themselves, some do not have a roof over their heads, or they do not have access to a device. For an example, there are some students at Generic_School that do not have food at their home and all they eat is school lunch. It hurts to see Children that are not able to afford things in life that are in need such as, education. Education is in all of our life's and I hope traditional schools can still be popular as online schools. In this generation techonology is taking over students!.

In conclusion, I support my reasons and my opinions about, traditional learning is a better way to learn than online learning. They both have Pros and Cons but Traditional learning has been in our lives for so many years and techonology and devices are taking over students. Distraction is what young adults have trouble with, Online classes is not a great idea to pursued. There are many reasons and studies, why students should keep attending traditional schools. I also believe everyone works and learns in their own pace and that is why Person-to-person is way to pursued.                        ",3.0
"Classes Online At Home

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Some people think it is good idea to take classes online. They say they have more time to do they homework. Some people think that take classes online is more easy than going to school. But I think that is more difficult because nobody explain you the thing. If people take classes online they will be not learning nothing. In my opinion it's not good idea because people need help from teachers, some people like to come to school, and they like to distract at school.

Some people like to do they work by they self, but others people need help from teachers. For example my sister always stay after school for help from teachers. She said that they help her with the things she do not know about her classes. She said that she learn too much about her teachers, and she like to come to school because the teachers explain the work. For example when she fail a test she stay after school with the teacher, they review about the test, and she learn more. The teachers find the way to help students after school. The teachers have others things to do but they don't care because they want the students to pass their classes.

Some students like to come to school because they make friends and have fun. For example my brother Generic_Name like to play sports at school. He said that play at school it's fun because he talk with other people. School it's important because we have to know about other people and learn more about what is hapen at school. People have the opportunity to come to school everyday and learn. However, In my opinion is important to come to school because when you graduate you going to be happy with your diploma.

Others might say that classes online is good because they like to work lonely. The school distract people from their houses. Some people need distract and also need socialism with friends. At school is the place that people like and feel safe. For example my friend say that she get distract in school she play a sport, or do a activity with others friends. Also the best way to get distract is to speak with adults people that know more about life. Also distract is doing your homework and listen to music.

In conclution, the teachers help students and they explain the things that the students do not know and online they have to do by they self. Come to school is the best way to learn what you want with your life and want you want to became in your future. School have many distract like games, books that you can read and take home. I think students should come to school and not take classes online. The teachers are the best because they help to much the students. Also they are good persons because explain when you don't know nothing. School is important in life because you need a good education and go to college to have a good work in your future.                               ",3.0

And i think is more beneficial beacuse i dont think, Students would want to travel eveyday to school and back.

I think students they will benefit with this idea, because they are not going to spend that much money, In traveling to school eveyday. It will be so much easier taking classes only, because students will have more free time to do their own things, after they're done with all their schoolo work at home: for example; if the students works it will be a better option of taking classes only because he/she will have more time in getting ready for work, and been on time to work.

Reasons why I say it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing, It's because students they don't have to worry, about gettig in trauble for been late to school, Because if students will travel to school schoool, there will be a high posibility of not getting to school on time sometimes it can be for many reasons; for example: traffict issus, parents they might get sick or any other reason, It will be really hard for this students if schools wouldn't offer away to study and learn at home, schools they make it easier for this students who aren't able to come to school, Myself as student i think this is a really good idea made by the school, Bacuse it gives students the oportnity of study at home when they aren't caplable to show up to school for this type of reasons.

I am agree with schools that offers distance learning as an option for the students, Because some students don't have the ability as others students, That has the oportunity of riding the bus to school everyday from Monday to Friday, This students who takes online classes is because they really need it, And they don't have a way of getting to school eveyday , It might be more difficult for them , because they might not have someone to explain them as well as a teacher. Another reason why i think some students students take only classes is because some classes that they like, some school don't have them, and they really want to know about it, Aslo sometimes parents look trought schools to see the classes option they have online so they can apply to see if their sons can takes those classes online to learn about it. One of the major reason why student take classes online sometimes is because they don't have enaught credits, so they have to take classes online, Becuase even if they come to school they won't be able to graduate because they dont have all the credits needed, Some students don't live near the schools to come all the way to school so they decide to take the classes at home.",2.5

Students would not benefit from being able to attent classes from home because: students would not have a social communication with their classmates, students would not ask questions to the teacher for help when they need it, and students would not participate in class activies or projects.

Firstly, students would not have a social communication with their classmates because students are taking classes at home, there is not a way to meet new friends. For example, in the school students would know different types of people, races,and cultures. Also, students would know each other, share special moments, and have a friendship. Secondly, students would not be able to ask questions to the teacher because they are at home, taking classes online, sometimes students get confused or they have some question but they can not ask to the teacher. For example, students do not understand something, it is hard for them to ask about it because there is not a teacher who would answer all the questions that they need or if they are doing a homework and they get confused, it would be hard for them to finish it because they do not know if they are doing right or wrong their homework. Thirdly, students would not be able to participate in class activities or projects because they are taking classes by themselves at home. For example, in the school, students can work in groups projects, expositions, and activies. Moreover, when students work in groups, they can learn how other students work, the tecniques that they use and skill that they have.

In contrast, some students would benefit for taking classes online from home because, students feel safety at home, some students live far away of the school and they do not have transportation. Also, some students have jobs and other responsablities.

"Students would benefit, from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. There are a lot of kids with disabilities who wants to go to school but they are afraid of being bullied by other students in school.

There are some parents who are in college, and have many responsibilities and still needs education. There are some other kids that needs to go to school but can't get out of their houses because of their sickness or health conditions.

The first reason why students would benefit from attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, is because of those kids with disabilities who wants to go to school ,but are afraid of being bullied because of their physical appearance. I remember when i was young , i used to get bullied in school because of my bow legs. Kids could laugh at me , and that used to hurt my feelings at the point of not willing to go to school.

This same thing is still happening today to a lot of kids in different schools , that they don't want to go to school because of being bullied and judge for their physical appearance yet they can't do nothing about it . That's why classes from home by way of online would be so important to kids who are going through this kind of situations.

The second reason is because of the parents who are in college and have many responsibilities, as taking care of their families and work, but still needs education.

Last year my sister had a baby, yet she was getting ready to graduate in college. She couldn't stop studying just because she got a baby. The online classes from home helped her a lot , because she was able to nurse her baby and take her classes at the same time.

The third reason is because of those kids that needs to go to school, but can't even dare get out of their houses because of their sickness. I had a friend who had a very bad disease that could't allow her go outside where there is sunlight because it could burn her skin. She wanted to go to school but she couldn't because of her health condition. The classes from home by way of online helped her finished her high school studies and graduated.

Some people may disagree by saying that students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online, because they won't have fun, make friends and other things, however i believe that they would benefit because a lot of those students who take classes from home by the way of online, ends up finishing their studies, and their wouldn't be any difference from the one who made it in school. Having friends and fun is good but ain't the priority , the priority is to get what's important and what will help in the future.

Yes, students have a huge benefit ,from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.                                                 ",4.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing? my opinions students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, sometime students doesn't have time when students free they will be done online class or homework, test,assessment. some students doesn't have parents so,they need to work and make money pay for rent and food. some time they will be sick and they won't attend class. some time students take action and going to visiting some place they will be attend online classes. now every area social online. Students use phone they will looking for YouTube,and they learn some think there video. when students doing online classes attend if they didn't know that they will be taping the Google and students get some information.

First, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, sometime students doesn't have time when students free they will be done there homework,test, assessment. some word students doesn't understand but they will be taping on the phone and translation from another languish or they will be looking for dictionary. where students doesn't matter because they will be doing online class any area, any place. example:-1. students traveling to bus workplace,rest time, talk to another person. many parent think students does,t leading any think at home they are always use the phone and play game, taxing masses,talk to another person said parent, But not like that one because they will leading some think there. student taxing another person students learning to spell correct. when student talk to friend the will learn to correct tone.

Second, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because,some students doesn't have parents so, they need to work and make money pay for rent and food. Students work a lot so,students not attend classes. i know how will be going to schools they leaning a lot. when students not understand teacher enplane every think and explain math. at schools have time what time students enter the class what time go to next class and what time lunch every think teacher make time table. students follow the rule. some students it's fine this rule some students it's not find this rule. So, students at home take online classes they will be make a time table. Schools have teacher to learn and at home we have friend,brother and sister every body teach them. if students does't have a family they will call the friend and talk and discourse to the project and homework. My be they doing go to Google and taping problem sentence and students gets some answer. Students learn to fast looking for video.

Third, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, some time students will be sick and students won't attend classes. if that time students have online classes students doing homework and project,assessment at hospital and at home. Students sitting in the hospital they are boring if students have some attend class they are doing some online classes. And they students have time going to fast. Students attend classes finish they doing some plan. But, students doesn't to make plant January is to rarely to know this information because, students plan after depend school on there teacher and consular. And summer , winter vacation too and there plane my be change. So, students,would benefit from being able to attend classes from at home.

Finally, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, now every area social online. So, some time students take vacation and going to visiting some place and they will be attend onion classes. students use of cellphone with at home and work traveling time so students attend online classes. schools have five day a week a class so students want to spent time with family. students want to go to vacation with family looking for new place. students want to all the time free. they don't want stay one place. When students will be go to new place students mind fresh and they think they will be doing every thing. So online classes should benefit for students. When student mind fresh there mind new think they learn new word. So students active doing every thing and students tell there friends and they will be decide go to there pace. There are learn for social and active physic subject.

In conclusion, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home now every area social online so, use of cellphone and computer,lop tap with doing attend the classes at home. we are looking for video and talk with friend,we are learn some think there video. if students have online classes students make some plan going out side with family and friends and students doing to attend online classes. Now students very smarts because students attend online classes and students no depend any body all.

"Do you really think student are going to learn just sitting on their vidoeo game? The issue that the studenrs are going to come across is that they are not getting the help they need and they are not even smart enough. Stiudents studying at home is not something that should be allowed anywhere, although yes school is boring and there is nothing to do, but we should be blessed to have a free public school.

Other places around the world parents/gardians have to pay so much money that it is just redicouls and the majority of students don't go to school because they don't have the funds for it.

Home school should not be around, because the students are taking the bafit of the home and most of the home school student don't graduate or finish high school because they are too busy being home doing all the unimportant things when they should be in school getting work done and hopefully graduating. In case students do take the online schooling they should at least have someone monter them and see the progress they have done every wee or two, this way it is going to lower the mount for students that don't graduate.",3.0
"My first paragraph is , I think that some schools offer distance learning, for students because if they dont want to attend to school in the morning ; for example they can take that classes online, the classes that they miss the day they are out of the school . Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because if they are in High School and if they are in 12 grade , and they need some classes to pass they can take online that classes . Because if they dont pass that classes they are going to lose the year in High School , and all the students they are not going to graduated.

My second paragraph is , what I think is if schools offer classes online and/or video conferencing , to the students that means that they really want to help students when they dont attent to school. For instance ; that schools are really good they need to help all students that they need some help , if they offer that classes online is because they want all the students to work hard every single day at home or anywhere, they wanted to work on those classes online , and if you take classes online you can take notes to help you when you have to take a quiz about what you read and what you know.

If students deside to go school , they can take all the classes that they want to take . They can take in the school were they went but; if they don't want to take classes online its does't matter what they want to do if they work from home by the way online , they can work in the school if they want or at home if they wanted to work really hard without any reason and if you get good grades on that classes and you understand everything you can pass that classes.

That school's give us a oportunity to work on classes online , if we want to work with other's classes that we don't have yet . For example , if you at home don't have any internet , what you can do is if you want classes online you can go to the library and work on those classes there , you are not going to pay nothing if you work on that classes , they give you free that classes that's why the school's give you that option to you and for all the student's if you are a smart student and you study really hard , you can finish that clases in less than a moth but if you study hard every day at home or at school that can help you.

"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I extremely disagree with those schools that are offering distance learning for students because students wouldn't be benefit from attended classes from home the students just will be worth probably, they would like to take online classes but then they wouldn't attend they might be sleep, and they wouldn't care about the online classes.

The several schools that are offering online or video conferencing classes to students, those schools are doing that in the worse way, because those schools that are offering online classes just would make the students more lazy to attend to school and to receive classes with the teachers at schools, but I believe that students better attend to school than to receive online classes because attending to school the students get an opportunity to know others students and make new friends, and being at home receiving the online classes students don't get the opportunity to know, and meet new people from the same age as them so that's why I believe that those schools that are offering the distance learning to students to receive online classes are doing in a bad path.

Although some say that students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is much better, because students don't has to attend to school and receive the classes with teachers, actually students shouldn't attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because students wouldn't learn the much as they learn at schools with teachers, and some students doesn't have internet or electronic devices at home to attend for online classes.

Some say that students should attend to online classes or video conferencing. One reason, school offer that option because they don't want to student waste time to attend to school and they believe that students would be benefit receiving classes from their home. However, students can have more time to sleep for those who work until midnight can be a benefit receiving those online classes, but to those students that doesn't work it would not be a benefit even though it will be worth because they just will waste their time on the phone all day and even in the night too because they wouldn't have to wake up early and get ready to attend to school.

I extremely believe the opposite, students shouldn't attend to online classes or video conferencing because students will just waste their time at home and not taking the classes on their computers or others electronic devices. Otherwise, Some others students doesn't have the same benefits as the others have for example: some students doesn't have the sufficient money or the same opportunity as the others to buy an electronic device such as computer to receive the online classes, so those students has to attend to school and receive classes with the school personal, that's one reason why I extremely disagree with some schools option like the learning distance. Another reason, attending to school students learn more faster than being at home with a computer because when they are receiving the classes on the computer they will check their social media at the same time as they are taking classes. However, attending to school students can learn many new words from the school personal and leaning new words can be such a great benefit.

In conclusion,

however some say that attend to the distance learning is better, but I extremely believe the opposite students shouldn't attend to the distance learning, because that wouldn't be a good benefit in their education, and in their knowledge students that take the distance learning they wouldn't learn the same way or the much as they learn when they attend to school and the teachers teach.

I disagree with the distance learning that some schools offer to students because the distance learning it wouldn't be a benefit for students who attend to the option distance learning it would be just worth it because they would not learn that much and probably they will not pay attention to what on the classes are teaching to them. Many students will prefer to take the distance learning just because they don't want to wake up early and go to school.",3.0
"Today technology is arriving into the schools. Some schools offer distance leraning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think that this would benefit students? I believe that it would not benefit students because of technology distraction, student behavior, and the different in capacity and ability for a student to understand things.

First reason, technology is an useful tool that people can use to learn or discover things, but it can be a huge distraction on young people. Today the technology is everywhere and it has everything which make it a powerful distraction for student's. Also, the students can copy any work from the internet while they are taking their online classes. The students will not learn anything if they copy every single work from the internet. Most students on school classes get distracted really easy by something around him, and also get bored when the teacher explain a new theme. I believe that is going to be more bored and distracted being at home alone doing conference and watching videos about the class. My home can distracted me more than my phone or computer, most kids have a video game, TV, family, and so others things that can catch their attention.

Second reason, student behavior can be a problem with online classes. A

lot of students do not respect or listen to their teacher at school, and

I am not wrong thinking that it would be the same at home with online classes. Most of this students do not listen to their teacher because they do not understand the way that the teacher explain or they do not like the teacher. So you can have an idea of how worst it can be i will give you an example, if a student do not like the subject of the day he can easily end the video conference with his teacher or he can just not listen to what he is explaining. The student can also not enter in to the class at the right time. I believe the there should be someone near the student to tell them what to do and how to do it.

Last reason, not all students have the same capacity to understand things. Not all the students have the same capacity to learn or understand by just watching videos or looking at pictures. I am a person who need someone to be physically near by so he or she can tell me how to do things. All the students that have this disability would be affected by this type of classes and this would make them to loose their credit on the class. At the same time this new type of classes is creating a barrier between students, teachers, and school.

Conclusion, the online classes do not benefit students because it can create a barrier between students, teachers, and school. The technology used for this programs can generate a distraction, and that can be a huge problem on future, the environment and behavior of the student can be a barrier too, and the different in capacity or ability to understand things can also represent an huge problem. At the end non one benefit from this online courses. ",4.0
"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

yes and no; yes, because students who are taking online classes or taking classes at home would be more focused, since there's no distraction like other students or teachers. No, because it is not very active socially and physically, unlike going to school, interacting with people, and playing sports.

Also, if the internet's not working then the student would have to skip the class because internet is what loads the videos and is used for face timing with the students. Some students can't learn just by watching a video or taking an online class, they have to actually experience the situation to understand. But the majority of the students can learn from videos and online classes.

Since technology is growing, I think in the upcoming future there will be just online classes that you can take and schools will be there but the students will go there only if the internet is down or any other internet problems, that way the students won't miss a single day of class.",3.0
"Students would benefit and not benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because you can stay at home ,not distraction,not friends or groups,tools from school that you may need,students can cheat.

Students would benefit from being able to attend school from home because you can stay at home and by staying at home you can wake up late for school. There is some students that hate waking up early for school that's one of the reasons of having the opportunity to take your classes in online. Staying at home you can be eating whatever you want there is not going to be teachers telling you that you can't eat. There might be people that doesn't have the transportation to go school and get in time for school and because children doesn't like waking 6 AM in the morning. That chance to take classes at online many students would prefer having online classes.

Other reason why students would benefit by attending classes from home is because there is not distraction at your home you can be at your room alone without no one to distract you when you're taking your classes or when you're taking a very important test. By being alone at home you can concentrate more about the things that you're learning because your friends are not there with you to distract you with another things.

Like I said there is not benefit too of having classes in online because students doesn't have friends or a group of friends to share their ideas. There is children that may need a group or a friend to talk about their ideas in classes or maybe you have a problem with something and you don't have no one to help you ,and by having not classmate it might be boring being alone.

students may need tools from school for example you need to read a book and you don't have one because you just don't own books at home and that's why I think it would not benefit because in school you have a library you can go there to find a book and there is different types of books students can pick.

Other reason why it would not benefit the students is because they can cheat.

students can cheat at everything because you don't have a teacher that is taking care that the student don't cheat at a test. If the students doesn't want to do a class he can can pay someone to make it for then ad pass it for them.

Different people might have another opinion about taking classes at home but I think there is benefit and not benefit because students can use this opportunity to waste their time or take advantages about having classes at home. In my opinion there will be some students that will take this serious and do the right thing.

"No I think it wouldnt be good idea to teach students from home. I think it would be a bad idea because students could easily get distracted at home. Students could just not answer the video calls. Students could just simply also not keep up with the work due to improper communication.

Students could easily be distracted in video conferences with other things. Things that could help them not attend to the conference that is going on. As for classes that are taking place online, Students could just not be doing the work and be on other pages.

It can be easy to not attend any of these classes, you could just not show up, do the work , or simply just sleep in. If you dont attend these classes it could lead to serious consequences. These consequences could lead to serious things. It would be better to have a physical class to walk into and attend.

Some students are better learners when you directly speak to someone one on one. Not all Students learn the same, some learn by being up and active such as athletes, mechanics, and others. Students that choose to learn online could also not understand a subject and could end up needing a little more help. Like me, I

need a little more help sometimes from teachers so I need a physical class and physical person to help me.

"some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home because they can not be on their telephone and not due what they are spouse to due.

First, they can get distracted, In my position

I Can get distracted went I am at home doing homework i want to wache TV even some time I do not finish my homework because i get a lot distracted. I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game.

Second, they can use the telephone some time I get a lot distracted whit my telephone because I away want to be in the telephone. Went i home I just want to be in my telephone and i do not do my homework. I get fully distracted because I want to text whit my friends or playing video games in my telephone and not Du what i suppose to to do. Went I am at home I have all I want my bed my telephone the TV the I forgot the I have to how or study for a quiz or test. Only because I at home and I have all i need some time i do not want to do anything

I get distracted fully easy and more if I have my telephone in front of me because i want to leasing to music or video chat my friend and talk and pay attention on what I suppose to due. Some time my mom tell that I have to stuff in the house so I have to do it even if I am doing homework or studying I have to what she say and then a can kip doing what i was doing. If I have my telephone whit me the only thing i what to do is be in the telephone because it is a easy way to get distracted and not due what you suppose to due.

Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. The is say for then because some the students do not ride the bus the parent have to take then to school and the take a lot of time some time because they have to wait. Even they are going late for work and they do not have tame to take then to school. They may say the if they have school at home they do not have to do all the work by taking then to school. some time a lot of kids get bully at school and it more easy for then do do it by home because they do not have to deal with at school they do to have to be worry what would happen to then the net they or what does people are going to do whit then, But I chose to not have school at because some people can get distracted I not saying the all people have the problem I am just saying the i have the problem they my not have. But I do not like have home school because i want to see my friend graduate whit then have fun some time go to party and now more people have more experience.

In solution, people can do what is best for you if you like do school by home because you do not like people or have personal problem or have i disability that you go it no one is going to say anything. But some time people want to have friends have fun because you are a person the like to be around people that good to. the only thing i am saying chose what is best for you not what is best for other people or what other people think.

"How can a students learn more from home than attend classes in school?. A student has more benefits if they attend to classes in schools because if the student can not understand a topic or has questions about it, the teacher can not explain by video conferencing as a teacher that can explain face to face an be sure that student understood. My second reason is a student does not have a person who trust or a person to appeal if He/She are passing for any personal or familiar problem. In schools We can find a lot of person as a teachers, counselor, police members, and psychologist to help students. My last reason is a student has to socialize with other students to be prepare for his/her future.

Firstly, if a student can not understand a topic and has questions about it, they can feel more comfortable to ask and said

""I do not understand, can You explain me again?, if they are with the teacher face to face. Generic_Name (My friend's name) decided to take the classes online, in the beginning He was so excited, but after one month He told me that was not a good choice because He does not feel comfortable asking a lot of question about one topic by the computer, and when He not understood something, He just do not said anything to the tacher who is given him classes by video conferencing.

Secondly, in schools we can find many ways to be help if we have any problem in home. Teachers, counselors, any person who works in the school can help us. In my junior year I had a classmate who was attending to the school but then she change her classes to online, When I ask her why she change her classes She told me that her mom was fired of her job and She had to start working to support her family. She was 16 when that happened she felt alone with nobody who help her.

Lastly, students has to socialize with other students to feel the sensation of surpassing. If they just does not want to attend school because they are shy or they does not like to interact with other students, We are not educating a good citizen. Students has to feel the sensation of surpassing when they do their homework or when He/She finished their assignments, that sensation the student can not lose. I read in a newspaper a case about Generic_Name, He was 16 when He attended to online classes, He never like attend to school when He discover the option for students to attend classes from home he decided take it. because He never like to interact with other students. After 2 years he graduated, but he never were prepare to socialized with persons, and that affects his personal life.

In conclusion, the offer to learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing in not a good idea because all of them are under 18, They does not have a good criteria to take that big decision that can bring serious consequences or affect their life.",3.0
"The argument related to distance learning has often been a topic of interest to many people. Nowadays, many scholars support the idea of distance learning and it has been getting a great acceptance among many societies. Although some people think distance learning make students careless in doing their work, nevertheless, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it saves the time they would spend by going to school and makes them more effective and efficient in their technology usage.

To begin, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it saves the time they would spend by going to school. For example, it can take ten to forty minutes for a student to go to school. This shows that going to school takes students' precious time and makes them unproductive. Clearly, no one wants to waste his/her time on transportation.

Furthermore, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it makes them more effective and efficient in their technology usage. For instance, students who spend their time on technological materials know more how to accomplish technology related tasks in a short period of time compared to students with no experience. This proves that taking online classes prepare students for higher education and learning. Obviously, the use of technology is growing fast in this age.

Overall, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. This is because distance learning saves the time they would spend by going to school and makes them more effective and efficient in their technology usage. In conclusion, schools have to offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home.",4.0
"Students would not benefit attend classes from home.

Recently, Generic_Name has been going to school the past 10 years.

In those years, Generic_Name has proved his apprenticeship by taking classes in the school.

More often his grades are the higher in the class, and his teacher is glad that he still going to her class.

Learning in school with a teaher next to him was important for Generic_Name to get those grades.

Teachers believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it makes student's attention lower, and they do not learn as the same way.

Firstly, student would not benefit from begin able to attend classes from home because it makes student's attention lower.

For example, Generic_Name wants to get out of school next week, yet he wants to takes classes online, but his teacher told him that is not the best option for him.

This example shows that the teacher is telling Generic_Name don't take classes online, it would not benefit his attention at classes in the same way that school does.

Even though, Generic_Name thinks that is the best idea, at the same time is not because the only way to don't lose his attention at classes is to continue the school.

Thus, attend classes from home is not going to benefit a student attention.

Secondly, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they do not learn as the same way.

For example, Generic_Name is a student of a New York's school, his teacher says that when he started classes online he did not learned as the same way that he used to do at school.

This example shows that when Generic_Name did not continue classes in school he started to have problems with the topics because students can not learn in the same way that in school.

For Generic_Name was not important learn properly in home or school, but for his teacher yes becuase they knew already that it would not benefit learning in the same way.

Thus, distance learning is not the best option fro a student.

On the others hand, some people believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

It is true, it can be possible when a student do not speak the language, and his/her parents prefer that the student take classes online.

However, still proof that students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home.

For example, the teachers of Generic_Name and Generic_Name say that distance learning does not help students to improve their attention and apprenticeship.

Thus, it can benefit students the classes online in 20%, but the classes in schools benefit students in a 100%.

In conclusion, to restate the point students would not benefit attend classes from home.

The first reason is because it makes students's attention decrease.

Further, students are not going to learn in the same way that they used to do in school.

However some people believe that taking classes online from home will benefit to the students.

Thus, coming to school is the best way that is going to benefit the students to attend in classes.             ",3.0

"Online classes, i think that if students really trying to learn something is not need for them to take classes online but sometimes, teachers cannot teach al the students well because is only 1 teacher and like 30 students in every class room, and i think that online classes are not a bad idea because they been teach by a computer and they have to pay attention or they will fail, but at school they wont fail that easy because they can get copy from another students and thats how they will pass classes better at school then online .

Now lets really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they cant go to school in case that they had a car accident they cant walk but they parents dont want them to fail the school year , or they dont feel like going to school thats why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice everyday.",2.5
"Are you one of the students that is home schooled? If not, here are some of the benefits, why some students choose to attend classes in their home, by the way of online or video conferencing.

Some people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, it's more safer, and they can avoid bad influence from others.

Attending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. For some reasons, some students that go to school can't be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then sometimes, some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they don't want to listen any objection from their action. Another reason for home schooling is that, it's more safer for them to study. For example in today's society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they don't really even that much know, and many more characteristics.

Although students will have benefits of attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits. Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing can really benefit to the students because one of the biggest benefits is that, they are more safer to study in their homes, they have a great time to focus in their studies, and they can avoid bad influence from others.",3.0
"Would doing school work at home benifit you? Working from home would benifit me because I can take breaks whenever I need to, as some students like work on the computers, and may see their family.

First, when working from home I can take breaks so I don't get stressed or angry. Some students need time to finish their assignments and not be counted as late. Students possibly have late assigments because they get stressed during school hours and they don't want to do it at home. However, if they work from home, they can complete those assignments at anytime and still get a 100%.

In addition, some students like to work on the computers better than on paper. For example: I like working on the computers because I like to multitask, so in this case I prefer working on the computers more then on paper. Mulltitasking is better for me because I like to listen to music and do some homework. Multitasking is a skill and not everyone has it.

Lastly, some students don't want to leave their family and prefer to be at home. For example: I have a sister that can't leave my mom, and I bet that she prefers doing school work from home. Personaly I prefer working from home and not leave my family. However, we do need to leave them at least when we're 20-21 or sooner. Working from home would benifit me because I get to be on the couch and not be sitting under the desk. I do like the confert at my house better then in public scools.

Overall, Working from home would benifit me because I like to work on the computers, I can take breaks, see my family, and be on my couch.",3.5
"Take learning distance on home is not good ideas . first reason is not the same to take on school. when we going schools we have more option to learning. sometime when we don't undertant something we can ask the teacher for helping or they can explain many times. But sometimes we have to take the classes on home. for example if you are sick or have a spcific reason that you can going schools is necesary take online because if we whant to learn is the matter we we have to take the classes. the important thing is that we have the energy to continues with your goals.

The Learnig distance on home some time be helping to be more possitive and focud because we can take the clases any hours we can. Also when we cut the clases on home we have more chance to listining. The other option to take the clases on home is that we can do other things that we whant.

Some schools give the chance to often the clasas on home that is great ideas. but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student. Also take clases for video conferencing or going school is little similar becuaser we can see the teacher that is explain the clases. That uniquet things is we can not ask the teacher for helping.

In conclusion. To be attend on schools is more important and helping more tham the distance learning or video conferencing. On my posisition attend on schools is more necesary because we have more opportunity to learm and continues to do the things that we whant.  ",2.0
"Being able to attend classes online is a dream come true. Many students miss a huge amount of school days because of personal reasons, health, or sports. However, taking a online class would resolve those issues. Students would benefit from online education because there's no reason to miss school and to work in a better environment

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Weather can also cause school to cancel. For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all. Instead they'll have all the time they need. Adding on to classes going by to quick, classrooms can get very loud. Unlike a classroom filled with students, your home is peaceful with no distractions.

To conclude, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. On the other hand, some students think online school isnt for visual learners but online class has many ways to educate visual learners.

Online class has video conferencing to help better understand. Online school is for every student.                         ",3.5
"As teen mature, they make opinions about issues that can affect them. Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students should not be benefit to attent classes from home.

Students would not be able to socialize with other students. For example, staying home every single day and not going out can lead you to depression. I personnel can't stay home all day and only focus on school. Also, teenagers need to interact with people more often and not be home all day. In conclusion, students need to get out of their home to clear their mind about all the work the school gives them.

Students would not be responsible in the future. For example, when they grow up they will not have the knowledge and the resposability it take to get a job out side of home. Students would not know all the resposabilities it takes to wake up every single day in the morning to go to school and do all the work that is required to do to be able to graduate. In other word, it will affect them not knowing how hard it's to work hard for something they never force them self to do. In conclusion, teenagers should get the experience and the hard work it take to be successful in life at a young age.

While some people believe that students should not be benefit to attend classes from home, others argue that students should be benefit to attend classes from home because they can do their work on their own pace. Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school. For example, Schools have many activies that can be helpful for students futher in life. Students will not know how it feel to be part of a team or how to work as a team. Also, In the furure sometimes they will be required to work with a group of people but they will not be comfortable because they never had that experience. In conclusion, Students wouldn't be able to do any activies in school.

Students shouldn't be allow to take classes at home while other student's go to school. First, Students will be isolated in their home all the time. Secondly, They will not know the hard work they need to put in to achieve something. Finally, Students wouldn't be able to enjoy the life of a teenager.

"Students having the option to have distance learning would only be great for students who are responsible and cable of keeping up with their assignments. Distance learning is beneficial to students because they won't have to worry about getting up early to go to school and also, don't have to worry about that amount of time they have in class to finish an assignment. Taking online classes gives the student more freedom to expand their thinking while having their own space at home.

A way that distance learning benefits students is not having to wake up at 6 or 7 am in the morning to go to school. Some kids don't show their full attention in school because they're not a morning person. Having to wake up in the morning and sit in a classroom for 2 hours is uncomfortable. For example, I'm not the type of student that can sit in a classroom for 2 hours or more and listen to a teacher talk. I would, prefer to move around and also eat while i'm doing my work that makes me feel more focus. But, in high school your not allowed to randomly get up and walk around it would make the teacher feel unsafe or the students. Waking up at 9 to 10 is a good time to start your online classes because you had enough time to wake up shower , eat and that most important part is that you dont have worry about what clothes your going to wear to school.

Another reason that distance learning is beneficial to students is because as high school students is not really easy to keep up with a teacher. when they're teaching a lesson with 28 more students in the classroom that probably already understood the assignments. There are some teachers are just not the type to go back and repeat their self. For example, When a student miss class it feels like you missed a whole quarter. The teacher is not going to explain the whole lesson to 1 student she would simply say check online for the assignment. This is an example of why students would prefer to take online classes because theres no way a student can be absent. Student can walk around anywhere with their computer or phone and simply pull up the school work and start doing it on their free time.

Some students would say its better to come to school, meet people and have the high school experiences. Although it sounds fun. Theres still students that would prefer being home and getting their work down at home then being in school dealing with drama or extra assignments. Theres students who would rather focus on online classes and finish them and also have a part time job on the side to help them pay for their colleges.

In conclusion, distance learning is an advantage to students who are proactive and for students who learn better on their own. Having to do your school work online and especially at home makes it feel more comfortable. Its also helping students get ready for the real world when they have to take home assignments from work and make sure to stay focus.     ",4.0
"There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class.

First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like ""can I use the restroom?"", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes.

Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is ""Generic_Name"". In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher.

Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying.

In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.

"Online school a great tool for young scholars that might not graduate on time due to missing school days, or any other inconvenience. Online school could not only help scholars to graduate on time, but also help a portion of scholars that are looking to get a job for future education, or helping their households. Online school may also be a helpful option for scholars with disabilities, or illness that might stop them to attend school.

Although online school might be a good tool for some scholars it can also cause negative outcomes such as students not doing their assign work, or not passing the class due to less time with students. Other issues that must be faced ,are some students not having computers, or not having access to the internet to do their assigned work. Overall online school is a great tool for students that may struggle to attend school. Once its issues are met and something has being done online school may not be only a great tool for some scholars but also an opportunity to finish school without any issues.

In conclusion online school might have many issues but once its issues have being solved and students get help with access to computers, or internet it could make a big impact on young scholars. Online school may also help economy by allowing students to have enough free time to get a job to help in their households, and their future.

because they have to work, pay bills and stuff like that.

-Some students get out of the schools becauses they wants to help their family , and pass more time with them; take caring of they youngues bothers, sister, or work to get many into their house.

Taking classes at home wil be the better options for the studens which ones wants to conitinue their carrier after high school, into the university,becasuse they can have a time to work, and to pay they carrier , and to get done what they wnats to be and their future ...

"If schools offers students distance learning as an option, that student should take the offer. That's my opinion if a school ever offer me online school. If I would have chosen this offer, I would have 3 reason why I agree that offer. Student should always think first if a school offers you something.

My first reason is, student can take their time in the morning to wake up and take a shower. For example, if a student wakes up late to school, that student wouldn't have time to do stuff he/she planned in the morning. But online school, that student can wake up late and take their time what he/she planned in the morning. My second reason is that its less cheaper. In online school, students only need: a computer, notebook, and something to write with. Students also receive free food from their home. But in regular school, some student pay money to get food, and the supplies for each class can be expensive. My last reason is student sometime finish their online school early, and have the rest of the day to play games, or hang out with friends.

In conclusion, student should always pick the right decision, when it comes to a offer in school. I think online school is good for students. Why, because if a student that is having family problems, and missing school every day. They can take online school, so they don't fail a grade, or miss any important assignment.",3.0

First, not every student can learn by just one explanation, many students need a teacher showing them or explaining how to do something. Take for example my cousin, She's taking online classes but has a difficult time learning the material because she doesn't understand the explanation they are giving her. Her struggles with the material is there because she doesn't have an actual teacher explaining why such ans such are like that. Not many students have the capacity to learn off of the words of a website. Many students need that extra help, whether its a different way of learning or just a better explanation.

Secondly, A large amount of students take extra-curricular activities. Many are in an art club, Spanish club, and maybe even drama. The struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didn't know how to draw the picture. Extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher.

Lastly, Students can even forget they have an online class. Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work. For example my cousin, she sleeps a lot, By the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due. Online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class.

In conclusion, online schooling isn't very beneficial. I believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students. Many need a teacher to show them face to face content, some take extra-curricular activities, and majority of the students forget they even have an online class. For those few reasons is why online schooling shouldn't be an option to students. ",4.5
"Should some school offer distance learning for students to attendend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people are agree with these class, because classes in online it's bennefit and better for students, students can learning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. If the students will can study in classes online they can have a big opportunities and they can follow his dreams and has the all they want to do or they want to has.

One reason it's classes in online is benefit and better, students can learning more and they can have in the house because they can do a time for make all things they needed make, for example I want to graduate and I want to follow study but it's difficult for me because I don't have time for anything I can't not make my homework, and study for my quizz. I need to work for buy my things, pay my house and my car. It's for these reason that I frefer class online, with these class I can have a lot time for me, and I can make my things and I can do the two things study and work.

The second reason is the students can do a better work, and they can have a better grade. They can turn in a good homework or proyect with more information explained. For example when the students have more time, they can make a better work, because they are enfocus in his obligation like homework and proyects, and they want to be a good student is for that they can do effort for turn in a good proyects with the use the internet. They can do a good investing for make a homework they can find a lot information, if the students are a relax and they have a time they only need to study a few hours no is like in the school. In the school is more tired because they need to wake more early and they need to do a lot homework in the many classes. But if they study classes in online it's more easy not it's very hard like in the school.

Some people say that the classes online it's a lost time the student do not make nothing in his house, when they have classes online they lost time. For example, when they are in the house they play with the cell phone or they are using his phone for other things, and they not study and not learning like in the shool. However, the classes in online is wonderfure because is a way to spend with the family because they can make a day fun with them and make differents things like play football, wath a movie, they can go to the cinemark and other places that they prefers.

In conclucion class online it's benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because students can lerning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. This is important and benefit because students can make a lot things, and they have a more time for make a lot things wathever they want. If the students take a classes online this is benefit for them and have a lot adventages, and they can do the both things work and follow study in online classes and they can follow the goals like find a good job and finish his studies.

"Distance learning was popular, and had so many students and parents chose instead of attend in class. It is convenient and highly support for students in many different way. In the other side, it has a limited things become disadvantage for students who taking classes at home such as communication to solve the problems, competition each other and experiences inspiration from teachers. Those are the most important things school offer to students. It is made valuable that distance learning never could gives to students.

The first and the obvious things that students would not benefit from distance learning is communication. Communication is the the person gives and exchanges information to the others, either verbal or non-verbal. For example, some students have watched video, and they still misunderstand and how would they figure out what they have learn, different teachers is different way to teach. Instead of video conferencing, school offers to students time to see teacher, professor to discuss their problems and find out what they were struggling with. That is why communication so important that distance learning can not offer to students.

The second advantage to being in class instead at home is competition. Competition is person versus or competitive with another person or group, each of which is trying to do better than all of the others. The best example is the one student in class got an highest score test, the others will do whatever it takes to get higher that score was. School always creating the competitive for students to participate, and that way makes students get more interesting at work help them to prepare for examination. That is the reason why competition is necessarily and advantage that distance learning would not have to offer students at home.

The last thing students could not get from online classes or video conferencing is the experiences and inspiration from teachers, professors. The experiences is the knowledge or skill gather from the pass; the inspiration is person with confidence and desire to do something that makes the the other people follow. During the class, not just the lesson from the math or English or Science, students would receive a life lesson from their teacher. Teachers could share the experience from their pass and motivation student who has the same the path, then students would not struggle with the same mistake they did. That was the most valuation that students can not get anywhere except in class.

Eventually, classes give students a lot of thing that they would not benefit from being at home. Attend to class offer students communication to easier solve their problems, created competition place for students and experiences inspiration from the teachers for students have a better way to learn. Those things that online learning students would never received. class is not just a lesson, it is also the small society that students should have before the real life. That was the reason why attend classes better than onine learning at home. ",3.0
"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.

1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!

2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldn't ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you.

3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.

In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.",3.5
"Should we as students learn from home or school ?. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school.

Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. In my opinion, It's a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. In another case students won't do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. What if a student gets sick at home ? they won't do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. That's my first reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My second reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that there's no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isn't any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. That's my second reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My final reason why students shuldn't attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. For example, what if students don't attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home. For example, if they don't do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. Students can give up easily and just contiune their life without any education. That's my final reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home.

In conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students will cheat on a test or quiz while they are home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. So in my case you should talk with your principle about this offer, unless there's a sicknees happening throughout the world and it's making school to shut down and do online classes.

"I think some student take a class at home because they live to far or they not have any transportation however the students can study for video or for online, but I think that is not benefit because it most better to learn more going to the school, for example the teacher they wants to theirs students learned but something they can put a lot homework because they want to their students learned however some student they live to farm from the school but they take the bus or they take the train and another transportation because they want a do something on the future, but is not bad idea to the students take class on the home because everyone wants to do something on the future for example if you someone wants to do something on the future they need to going to the school or take class for online becuase the school very important however not everybody have the same opportunities.

But I think the online class is not benefit for the students because they can not learn better maybey the students they can not consentrate good at home becuase they distrate for something and they cannot learn about the lesson and maybe the teachers they cannot teach good however on the schools the students they cannot distrate and they put attention when the teachers theach the lesson better however they force the students to put attention because the teacher wants their students learned.

However some people they don't have the opportunities to going to schools but they pay a class for online maybe they work the all day and they wants to studies, for example, the hispanic people they work immigrant to this country but the work hard to pay the rent and other bills but some people they wants to learn English to have a better wrk so for the reason they pay for online class becuase thyey wants to learn other language or they wants to have a better job so for the reasons is benefit for they pay for online class however not everyone have the same oppotunities.

The school is very important but some students doest like the school and some students like the school becuase they want to do someone on the future so if the students wants to do something on the fututre they need to have a dreams because the person doest have a dreams they don due anything because we can take the opportunities to the parents give to their childrens becuase some childrens on the world they wants to have any opportunity.

But in my opinion some people is possible to take a class for online maybe is not possible to their going to schools but they can pay classes for online but is not the same like the schools but they can due if they have dreams they can due because everybody have dreams.",2.0
"Yes, I do agree, because it's a great way of learning because we don't have to deal with other kids in school, we're save because we are home, we don't have to worry about going out to the dangerous world that we in now. For example I have friends that do school at home and they are just like regular kids from High School, a lot of people would say that being home school its like going to prison but it's not, home school just gives us a better way of learning at home with no one to bother. Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abues in school, not dealing with any problems with other students. Another benefit of being home school is that you dont have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you don't have to miss the bus anymore, don't have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school dont have time to go out or have som fun, not many kids are able to go out becasues their parents are strict and dont let them out but that's besides the point, many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them becasue they dont want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with thme so they don't have to miis out on their aventues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the out side world becasue their education was high quiality and always on point. They are good kids and bad kids that do home school, some of them coud have got in a ot of trouble and its not able to go back to school and some kids are home school because their patrenst have to work out of the country and they can be home by their selfs and they take thier kids with the. That's all I have to say.",3.0
"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes for home? In my opinion that wouldn't be a good idea but also be a great idea. School should allow students to decide if they wanna attend at their school, home, or both. Anyways it's a good idea that some school allow their kids to attend classes from their own house.

Allowing students to attend classes from school is good idea. That's giving the students time to do there work and to learn whenever. Students could sleep one or two more hours in. Most kids either play sports, have a job, or maybe both. They won't get much sleep then they will be tired the next morning. If we could have classes at home students wouldn't have to worry about sleeping in class and getting yelled at by the teacher. Most students wanna be home school because they either get bullied, tired of getting in trouble, but mostly students these days wanna graduation early.

If we also had classes at home more kids will be more safer than at school since what's happening right now in 2018. students wouldn't have to deal with getting suspend or expelled because most kids these days get that. School wouldnt have to deal with drugs, gang violence, or anything that's harmful to the school. Then school drama wouldn't happen a lot in school if we could just be home. It will also be a great idea if we could attend classes from school and at home.

It wouldn't be a good idea because most students wouldn't do anything or make someone else do it. Some students like to be teach in person and if they were at home then they can't learn at all. some students are just too lazy. What about gym and other non core classes? We could have a time when they gotta start there class and if they don't sign in then they get mark absence. If they have a non core class then they can just go to school to take it but most classes you could probably take online.

I hope you think about changing school to allow students to take classes at home, or allowing them to take some at home, or both. Thank you for reading my paper hopeful you thought about everything and how it could change everyone problem. have a wonderful day!",3.0
"Some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. For those who can pay a fee for it would be perfect because they have the material to do that, like enternet, computer, or any other device to joing by online or video conferencing classes. Some students woul benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but just those who really need it, like students with disability or health problems. It would not benefit students whom have a hundred percent of their ability to develop anything, it would make them more lazy than what they normally are.

Generic_Name is a student who has a hundred percent of his ability but he does not like go to school. He is always skiping classes and never make homework. Generic_Name is a student with health problems who can not assist to school like a normal teenager because he has to be connect to a oxygen tank twenty four, seven. Generic_Name does not want to go to school and Generic_Name can not do that. The school which both of them used to attend is offering a distance learning program for students and the first two students who joing are Generic_Name and Generic_Name. If schools decide to create this program for students, them most priorize at the moment to acept students.

Distance learning program as an option for students to attend classes from home. It would benefit thousands of students whom really want to learn and be successful in their life. If schools which have this program available for students allow students like Generic_Name and Generic_Name to be part of it. The one who is going to be benefit more would be Generic_Name because he is the one who really need this program, he is the one who want to learn new stuff, he is the one who want be someone in the future. Generic_Name would be just one more of those students who are trying to take the easy way for everything, acting like if the world goes around him. But there is also an amount of students who can not have access to enternet or any electronic device to access to the online classes. So it turns a problem for those who does not have acces to any of those things and has health problems like Generic_Name or who does not have enough money to have what they need to participate. The online classes would be hard to them no matter what. If schools created a plan for those students it would be more easy to them to develop themself.

In conclusion some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, for students who does not have a hundred percent of their ability, student with health problems, students who really need it. Them also may create a program that help students without enough economy to take those classes. If schools are creating new ways or programs for those whom really need it, them most think about all the needs that them have and try to supply it, not with a hundred percent but helping with what they can. So students can learn and be successful n the future. Remembering that the one that are students right now, are the future of the world. ",3.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from honme by way of online video conferncing. Is good idea to take classes online or not good idea to take classes online?

It is a great idea to take classes online, this is in my openin because it is fafe the students times. Like (work in deffrent time ) (Famileis responsiblity) (Sickness and transportion) work in deffrent time sa we all know that work that may effect the time of students becaue is impossible any work places give the students the schedule that they want it. So after student done from work ,they can take online classes fom home that will make them more relax.

Because after work is hard to focus in the classes but if students take from home they will have time to ate and more fouse. Online classes can give more time to do other activety,like sports, go out with friends.

Sickness,transportion ,Parke if students sick so bad do they can go to school ofcurs not first of all the student who is sick can make the other student sickt too. So that's why the online classes can make the different for students additional sick persons may can not drive too ,and may not all students have cars and parking some time students vhave to pay fo parking too. Frthuer more the wather may not help smoe time to dive to anywhere.

Families responsiblit,it is good benefit from families ,being to attend classes online. Because there we all know may some of students have chidern, or students are disaplelty person ,example disapolty persons can not go bythemsevs to school in the issue the online classes can make for thses students a big different so they can take time off if they are not feel well,and take their pale in the time. And that will help students that don't want to school because of these kind of issue the online class will be btetter for them. Or if students are moter or father, it will be easy for them to kake care of their childern and take classes online . So there will calm in the mind of the students because they will know that wouldn't be missing classes. Hwoevery; they will feel busy in their time but at lest there is options which is online classes. The great benefit of online classes for mother or father that may be they are students is the time. Which if they have kids or teenagers the online claeese can be benefitationl bacuse they can speent time with their kids and teen to see if they are doign good in school.

"I think students would not benefit taking online classes or videos conferencing from home. Students not learn to much because they do not receive a good explication about the class as a real teacher would to explains in the school,

not have rulers and online classes not catches the students attention.

Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them.

Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they don't have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home.

Online classes or videos conferencing not catchs the students attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home and you are at the midpart of one the lesson but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allows that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and morer. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge abou it.

Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students. They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades. Other say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details.. They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing.

As you can see, taking online classes or videos conferencing from home, not helps the students to learn because if they are confusing they will get bad grades , nobody answer their question or doubts and they don't have rulers or limited to use any electronics devices. This is not a benefit for students.",3.0
"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I personally don't think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of you're classmates, and from being around people who already know enough to help you out. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think you'd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily.

Being taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. also, I think your brain focuses more when you're being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. For me it's so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because there's no one around to tell me that I can't get up or go to the restroom. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that we're similar to that one probelm I couldn't figure out, I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face.

When your in school you're never alone in a classroom because there's always other classmates and when you're homeschooled and it's just you by yourself. I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. Having people around you while your in class isn't always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes it's good to be around other people because you never know whose around and you don't know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me, I feel less lonely like that and well I don't really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work i'm doing, but that's just me i don't know how others are.

Thirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you don't have to be locked up in your house the whole day. In middle school I remember that I wouldn't talk to no one that worked at the school because I didn't trust them, until this day I still don't trust them but it wouldn't hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need. Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since they've already been through it. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and that's because school can help you achieve you're goal and you're career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve you're goal.

In conclusion, I think you'd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldn't you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesn't matter wether they're the ones who want to be homeschooled because you're the parent and your in control not them.

"Well In this part I

think is good and bad idea.

I think is good because if they have any emergency in home they do not going to dismiss any classes they can take classes from home they have already tools do not needed to go outside they have everything in home, and the teacher they do not need to wake up early everyday, and also some family they are going to agree because now they do not are going to think every time how is my daughter or my son if they are safe or if they are in trouble.

the bad things that if they going to give to all the students to take classes from only or video confederation some students they not going to do their work. in some others parts they do not have any internet or money to buy a computer they do not have opportunity that the others person have, also the teacher do not have any jobs they are going to need they works back, and some family they do not need to send to school to their sons because they do not have many or they want their son to work. Is very different have the people think is hard to take decision.

if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online , is going to be more easy from them because they do not have a job or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer thats is going to be a really good problem form them because they do not have school open or they do not have the materials they want for learn,

they have to look for job but sometimes if your looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future.

If you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school their have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school everyday, and do not get in trouble. Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility.

If you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer and maybe they going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their grow up.

if is a old is more easy from them because they brain is more they can understand and they do not have any issues to work in the computers.

so is bad idea that they students take class form online they do not have any money or they do not work. ",2.5

Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends.

Distance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. Sometimes, Generic_Name would not get good sleep, so it was very hard for Generic_Name to pay attention in class. I think that it was not Generic_Name's fault for not attending school on time. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class.

Distance learning can benefit students see school from a different perspective of learning. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. My cousin didn't like school at all. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the school's free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. My cousin's grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning.

In conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students. Also it can benefit people who believe that they are not good for school, so that they can experience a different way to learn and feel useful. I think that distance learning can benefit students with this kind of problems, improve and be equal like the rest of the students, regardless their way of learning.",3.5
"I think sometime is good online because any students no have time so many students work part time,then can't go to the school the better option is take a little free time and make online.

First :But is better they go to the school because if you need something you can took with you teacher or partner is past time with amazing friends and learning more about what do you want in the future ,the things and feelings ,ideas and occurrences ,memories and expectations and possibilities ,fear desires ,delight the smallest and most ordinary issues of our lives as well as the large and mostpowerful ones. then online web is the tools for study we have that permit us to share with others what is really going on inside our minds and hearts .they are the only intruments that reveal whether speaks and writes .

second : some times the students no came at the school because they live long them no have money for transportation or when need buy any book ,any students don't have the support of your family ,i think is the way more easy and very well for the people can do it some thing ,we need more people have want learning more the way the best election for our the student speaks , writes and lives not on a thing barren changeless level but with all the breadth and height and depht and movement yyou have a right to as a human being .As you ever open discover those words ,the online can be the most important web you ever open.

Third:There are probably very few people would claim online las their favorite book .However all the words are there ,it is the order ,But if you need company whose work it is to prepare materials that advance your learning and show you how to think for yourselves , the online web is the reason the words stand for things and feelings , from outline and notes to the final form of the paper .It tells you how to write paper .how prepare for applying for a job .However It gives you advice you need to choose the correct language and to avoid expressions ,after its helps you understanding their parts and pronunciation .

"Welll its going to be ah good beefit but in the same time it's a bad benefit to doing class in the house .

(03/10/2020).

The oportunity the not miss one class and be in you house is the best thing the can happen to one school students, this benefist the school and the students beacuse they never going to miss one day of school and the homeworks and tests to. In the actually some kids miss the school for be sicks, some familiar pass away ,they in vacation and they not return in time to the country , they miss the bus school and they can't go to the school beacuse they not have car ,oh they wake up late. This is a benefit because they can learn about the class oh activity and not miss homework oh test and be prepare for the next class in the school, and be in his house relaxing and be in a safe place and always have ready you homework oh test to next class and its ah good benefits to the people ho its in the hospital and can go to the school for ah broken legh oh medical condition .

But not everething it's good about this idea some kids maybe oh actually they gonna stop going to the school and stay in his house and skiping the school. this its going to affect them beacuse they can't sociable with other people ,they can have ah computer oh in his house, they not have wife oh cellfone and other guys oh kids will skip the online class to and go play video games,and they parents are not gonna have idea about what his kid did oh do, and during the test they can copy using this class peapers oh using his fone to find out the answers. ( In my case i will always if they give me the opportunity to online classes i will always stay in my house relaxing in my bed when i listening the class ) but in the end this option of learn in his house have his good and bad bennefits (some school in the united states are not using this becuse they not have personal wedsites and can garanteed if the student are going to use this ) .

( I have one idea in how they can do this in ah good way. The students ho miss the school need to call the school and inform why they not going to the school and need the have a parent in his house, then they send them the link of the online class and notify the parent if they are doing work, oh they are skiping the online classes, and they can have ah limet time of online classes so they can be focus to his work and doit on time and when they are doing ah test they doing the test in a video coferincing with one teacher if they and not chating oh copy during the test. ).

My personal opinion:

In my opinion its ah good offer becouse sometimes i miss the school bus and i can't go to the school becuse i not have ah car and i always miss the class,homework and tests, and this can be help me a lot to have all the work in time and be prepare for the next day of school and be ready take the class oh to take one test .

one sad fact:

In the intere world some kids can have this oportunity to have online classes in some countries around the world they not have the tecnology to do that so if they miss the school one its like they are missing one day of his life and fact even they are kids ho not are going to the school bacuse the parents not have money to send them to the school ( yep in some countries the education cost money and they not have free schools like united states ) and they have to work in one short age to help his family in my country was like this thaks to good i was alow to go to the school thanks to my mother and come her to the united states so when i come to the school her in united states and i hear students said i hate the school and i wanna be in home i remember my country and i said thanks to this country for give me free education (even in her they do video school conferencing to the people ho not coming to the school and i said wow , Even they do that for the students, and the students are doing protest to have more off days so what i try to said is always thanks to you parents for the education they are give to you and thaks always to you country to give you free education to you can be some one in you future and have a nice work and never ask why i not have this. and always think some in around the world not have the stuff the you have and always thanks to GOD for the stuff you have ( I always do that wen i wake up).

Extra fact:

In some countries i the world like China,South Korea,Russia... etc, the education in vidio its ilegaly in all school this is bacuse they think the education its have to be like the oll days paepar pencil and uniform (some schools in united states more in the private schools) and they not use laptops to do classes the have to read every single book and the attendence its obligatory what i read if you miss the school in that countries they punch you in the hands with one metal stinck ( like in some countries in south america) and the leave detention in the school and you have to writte in 10 oh 20 pages the i have to come to the school every day . sometimes they stay in the school all day bacuese they need study for ah test. I some countries ( South Korea ) its elegal have computers and cellphones in the school . in south america yeah they can cellphones and laptops in the schools but the problem its the internet so many people have to steall the wife to his neighbord.",1.5
"Students will benefit from being able to do the classes from home because maybe they have reason to do there or having some problems because some people doesn't like the community or having to many people around them. If I have a choice to choose one of them i think i will choice to go to school to know more people.

These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home.

The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they don't like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesn't want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they don't want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them.

The second reason is maybe other students don't like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students don't want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school.

Finally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they don't need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people don't think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them.

In conclusion is that if people choose the online classes and doing at their home they are free to choose because they equal are going to study but at their home they have reason to do there. But i will say that people don't need to care what other people is saying to them.",3.5

ONLINE CLASSES ARE BETTER THAN GOIING TO SCHOOL.

Talking online classes are way easier and better then attending/going to school. Some schools offer distance leaning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If students get this opportunity to take their classes online, ''I'' think it will be a good idea and they will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, Because Many students can't be at for many reasons,they can be sick or injured. Two, online classes help to students to take class at anytime they want . Three, online classes save students more time and money.

Many students can't be at school for many reasons, for example the student can be sick or injured. So the student getting the opportunity for taking or getting his/her work done on online classes will make it easier for the student, instead of students going to school when they're sick or Injured. So a sick student can stay at home and get his/her work done so they wouldn't be to spread the sickness or the disease around the school. And it can prevent people from getting sick too.

Online classes are easier because, students can take the class at anytime they want and do what every they want do after the class. For example Students get a job and make some money to pay for school fees and bills and also they can support their family with the money. And they can take the class after work or before work on online. Also online classes makes it easier for students who have jobs and the same time going/attending school.

Moreover, online classes can save students some money and time. Because driving to school everyday is a waste of gas, money and time. Students can save that money for gas and do something else with, for example they can pay bills with that money or even they can support they're family with money. In some cases the student can have family ''(kids and wife)'' and online classes can help the student to spread more time with his/her family.

In conclusion,

schools offering distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This opportunity will help students in so many ways. Students will get more time to get they're work done on time and also save money for them self. The students can do whatever they want to after taking the class on online ( spreading time with family and having fun).

"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attand classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Yes, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Less take me as an example; I had personal problems before, and It was auwefull. What If It was so bad that I couldn't go to school?! Some students are just not good at school, and just prefer learning from home online or by video conferencing. Other students that gets in trouble all the time are just better off learning from home. There, at home, there is no one to to fit with. You get your work done and you move on. their will be no more trouble.

Most of the times our parents say that going to school and socialism is good for us. Is that true?! Is that the case?! Well I am not sure about that, but what I do know is that I think we students should have the options to decide what we really are confortable with, and our parents should help us with that. Anyways, It's not like people at home are doing less work than people at school. We all are doing the same work, depanding on our grades. We all need to turn in our work on time or it will be counted late, same test, same quiez everything. The only differance between people that are taking online or video conferencing from people at school is that they are not going to school. They aren't in a classroom. We all have to studie for our test, quiez... But this is what my attantion goes to. Do students that attand classes from home, ever cheet?! we'll never know if they do. I would like an answer for my question, but I bet there will never have a proper answer.

There is a lot of resons why it is good for students to be able to take classes from home, and I will never be able to tell you all that resons. all I can think of is what I provided. It is hard as a kid or a young teens to go to school and have to deal with other kids, and I get it, because it is hard for me to deal with other kids too. But not all of those kids are hard to deal with. Online or video conferencing are not so bad themself, I will have done if I have the opportunity to.",3.5

"Some schools of the United States are looking forward to the day that students will attend classes from home by way of online. Dispite this exciment it can be not beneficial for some students in the way of learning. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it won't be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face.

Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline.

One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldn't offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. For example, my friend Generic_Name. He is attending one class online from his home. He says that he doesn't have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. And it doesn't include the warm-ups and classworks during the class. Requiring this ammount of work schools shouln't offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. If students want to take other classes they won't have time to do it. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school.

In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. She said yes. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people.

In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. These classes just make students's life busier than what they expected. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students. Students don't see benefits of attending online classes, instead it just make their life difficult in many ways.",3.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students should offer public classes, however, Distance schools will make students careless by doing online or video conferencing. Distance learning is not good because it would make cheat easier, there would be less social interaction, and they would need to be highly motivated.

Firstly, students would cheat easier. For example, If students allowed to use their technology system, It would be easy for them to do their work but It would be easy for them to go online to and copy the answers Some students have trouble working at school because they don't want to work.

some of teens says that they cannot understand to work at school.

Secondly, there would be less social interaction. For instance, when you are taking a test or taking notes at online school there are many distraction that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. Therefore, Learning from public school it won't have distractions that a online has. However, Students won't lose focus on what they are doing if they are only focus on their teacher and if they have questions, they can ask from their teachers so they would help them more. It would be more helpful if students come to school.

Some students says that Online schools have more highly motivated. For example, one of my friend, she used to come to school, but Furthermore, she stop coming to school, because her teachers won't helped her, she cannot understand well, she got bad grade, and she fail all semesters then she plan to start online school. she got the answers the error words which she didn't know. However, Online school are have much more opportunities than the public schools. online schools have more distractions on what you are doing and get more free time.

In conclusion, students should offer to attend classes because attending to classes are less stressful. Students get more help from teachers. there would be less social interactions, because they won't be distracted by any technology and would be focus on studies. Some students are more interests in online schooling because they get more free time and get more rests than the public schools. I think public schools are more helpful for everyone because you meet new people, learn different experience, you get new ideas from others, and it wouldn't make you stressful. ",3.0

"DISTANCE LEARNING

I think students can be benefit because they can have more time, if they have job or they need an extra class but, they could not be or stay after school or they just cannot come to school for personals reasons I think those students can be benefit.

First,student from high school much of them have a job and they need take class at home just for three hours and then rest to get ready to their job. They also can have time to do homework it's how it can be easy for them to study more and have a grade and graduate.

Second, if they are almost to finish high school, but they just need a credit and they don't want to be in school just for one class they should take that class online and have more time;

it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while they're at home.

Third, if the person have deformity they could not walk, or just don't want to come to school for different reason most be bullying, they can be benefit with the online class so they can get they class done and fine what they want to be in their future, also can have their graduation.

I really think those are the reason why they can be benefit with the online classes they have more time for homework, job, rest, and visit others place, and also they get the grade that they need that is how they're benefit.",2.5
"Online school can be more beneficial to a lot of student's struggling with grades and being late to school because of over sleeping or missing the bus. Going to school takes up a lot of time off stuff you're interested in doing outside of school like playing sports and spending more time at home.

I agree with online classes over going to school because some students feel more comfortable learning in their house rather then going to school. Some students also have trouble with over sleeping due to a lack of sleep causing them to miss the bus and be late to class. Online school starts in a more reasonable time of day so it's more convenient for those that over sleep to attend class on time. This allows students to have more energy which will help them focus on their work and be more productive in class. When student's get sick they miss days off school which causes them to be behind on class work, for some students being be hide on class work causes stress because their grades go down. But you can still attend online class if you're sick. You can also attend online classes while on vacation with a laptop you'll rarely have missing work to do which is a big positive for improving your grades.

However, some may argue that looking at the bright screen for a extended amount of time will put a strain on your eye's. Also that it's easier to cheat on test's and quiz's in online classes then it is to cheat in school, because the teacher dosen't know what your doing on.

That is my reasoning on why taking online classes is more beneficial then going to school.  ",3.5
"Offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing by schools is a good idea, but I take a position on this issue to say that, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes classes from home due to the following reasons.

First of all,some students when offered distance learning will not pay attention to their lessons. They will distracted either by their cell phones or electronic devices. And we all know students always like to be on their cell phones at anytime and anywhere. Also,Students can be distracted either by their parents or siblings which may cause them lack behind ahead of their lessons. So when all of this happens , students may be delayed which will cause them to fail and waste of time. For example,my cousin came to the United States of America with his siblings and he was permitted to to take one of his subjects or courses online. And anytime he gets home,he doesnt get a peace of mind because of the disturbances and worries from his siblings. Due to this,he fell apart in his studies which caused him to fail the course.

Another reason is that,some students finds it difficult and boring to learn on their own pace. Because they encounter a lot of problems in their studies. Students finds it very hard to understand lessons without the presence and explanation of a teacher. And again,students finds it very boring when learning on their own because there is no form of oral conversation between the teacher and student. Some students prefer being active in studies rather being dull or inactive. So when all these happens,the students may skip the contents because he or she doesn't get any understanding,

or close the contents and go to sleep. For instance,I had a friend who was struggling with these same problems,he feels bored and difficult to understand in distance learning. So anytime he gets to sit for the lessons,he feels sleepy during a short period of time. He sometimes drink a whole cup of thick coffee but it doesn't make any changes. So what he does is to off the computer and go to bed. And this hinders his academic performance each year.

Lastly,students feel fatigue or weak in distance learning since they don't get time to take rest after school. Some students even have to close work after school before taking the online class. With these,it makes student lazy and sleepy when he or she sits in fronts of the computer to learn. And me myself is experiencing this problem. When school closes, I have to walk half a mile before I gets home,and from there,I work on my assignments and take my shower. So by the time I will be done,then it is getting late, and I still have to take this classes online. I feel tired in learning at times which retards my level of learning.

From these reasons, I would like to conclude that,students would not benefit from distance learning because there are so many disadvantages from it which has brought low level academics in their studies.

Thank you.",4.0
"When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn.

For me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school everyday. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home.

Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate.

Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Some students can't catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught.

Finally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level.

Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.         ",4.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

My position on this issue, I think students would not benifits from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because schools programmes its helping you to get more informations, learning more things to get high level.

For example when you attend classes in the schools it will be conversations between the teachers and students about the term than you will benifits more informations and working between students like a groups its reason to get more knowledge.

attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have attention like in schools classrooms because the teachers they helping you to understand and explaine more.

When you have a research at schools attend classrooms you can use technology and books and you can work like groups it will be more easy to do your research. But when you have attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have a conversation between others students to get more knowledge.

In my opinion, I prefer schools attend classes because when you focus with the teacher you will understand more about the term. For expample in my english class i pay attention at the class i can understand, and when i have a questions i ask my teacher to explaine for me.

I desagree with students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some courses you can't take it at home because you you need to worked like a groups. For example when i have work to do at schoul classroom's we work together to make the exrcises or a topic easy, and when you get absent and you left some works the teachers helping you to do it.

The schools classrooms programmes will help you about the time and they have specific time to work confortable and to know what have to do, some students they need support from they teachers and counselors to make sure they do alright. For example when i need support my teachers they support and they give me enough time to make i understand everythings.

Students who choice to learn at home by way of online or video conferencing they will not get conversation with speaking with others and with teachers. For examlpe when you have to work on topic it will be hard for some students to understand more.

In my opinion for the students who prefer to attend school classroom's it's good decision, because they will have more infermations and more experience about the way to make a plan and more knowledge about the courses you taking at school.

I think students would not benifit from being able to attend classes from home.                                             ",2.5
"""Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home""? I do not believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I believe the students can get distracted so easily at home. For example, you start watching a movie; when you were supposed to your homework. That would affect your grade because you didn't do it on time. Another, example is when your mom tell you to buy something and then you forgot what were you doing. In addition, time is another reason why is not beneficial taking classes from home.

Time is one of the consequences attend to classes online is not beneficial because unexpected things can happen. You can't control time. For example, someone in your family die or they have a car crash or even work schedule. Those examples can affect you by reducing the time and material you were to work on. That's why you can't predict what is unexpected. Unexpected times take away your energy, concentration and comprehension on what your studying. Another, reason why classes from home isn't good.

Energy keep you awake. Being concentrate shows interest on what you doing and comprehension is how much you understand. If you're sleepy you cannot do any of that. However, I want to focus more in the comprehension part. Never ever compare a teacher vs a computer. For example, you didn't understand the new unit because is confusing, you can always put your hand up and ask the teacher. The teacher will explain at their best for you to comprehend. On the contrary, you can't do it because you're at home and nobody can explain the material you don't understand.

Some students agree they can benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can do it later, if they miss something on class. Also, they can study anywhere they can have access to it. That reject to be in certain place. You're free to study and work without any restrain. All you need is to manage your time.

You be able to kill two birds on the same shot.

To conclude, students will realize that a teacher is way better than a computer. The teachers study the materials on what they gonna teach and they graduate from college, gain a diploma of what they teaching you. They have the proof and I believe they are doing the right choices about giving you materials for you on the future. That's why i would never change them for one computer at home.  ",3.5
"I think students can benefit if they are able to attend classes from home, even know the distance but learning as a option for students who wants to finish a carear or have a good job.

Take those classes online or videos conferencing is not the same thing like to be able to go to classes. In class students can ask about any question they have or get the information they are looking for, and the schools teacher can see how they are learnig but, online they don't have much oction like read a book or be able to ask any question they have to anybody.

Attend to classse is great is a oction from student to choose but is the smart oction for for student who know what they want to do in they future. Schools is a place where students have the desition by you're own. There is where students can start makeing options and try finish what they really dream. Be able to atted classes from home is hard thing to discuss but when students are able to go there is great bacause is where they have to be and never give up during that time.

School is not a principle to starts getting information about how thing are working, or what options we can choose for be a porofessional after schools. Prevent oction in schools is preposterous because that is not ducing, good octions during school.

Students who rually have the decition to go to schools even know the distace but they are benefit. that is a oction, but when they get there is alot of information and option they can lissend from teachers and other students. When they go to schools they are giving a step more every day, to them life and they are benefit in school for the alot of option they can have in schools.

Schools is a benifif for all yung people to learnd how start life, when you get out from schools and have a good job. for have the opportunite, students need finish school firts. Not matter the distance or the skills they have during that period time. after that they will see how everything is change to be better in they way.

For somo students is hard to make that decition.

But when they have the oction and they can do it is a good thing because they can learning more about and have more opportunities when they graduate from schools thay have good jobs and more oction to choose.

Some students think is preposterous to to make decition in schools, bacause is alot of oction they can choose, and alot thing they want to be but they only have somo octions. For somo of then is hinder to go and pick that oportunities.

Instance when students live far fom schools is hard to get there they need like a car to get there, but parents are allways insist to students to go to schools not matter how hard is all they wants is a good future for they childrens.

School is a personality decition in life, butsmart decition for people who is looking for good oction in life. Ertheless who finish school have more oction the people who don't finish. During school students need have to be inmate because schools is a hard time.

For students in schools is like stairway, because they walk aroung getting information, that is a good oction for teachers, to stall information and try to preparate students to then life. One way to be a perfectionist is graduste from schools.

Fanally when students finish schools they did a good job and they have more option to choose. More of they have good jods or go to college and finish a carear, and they know how follow the the dreams, because when they was in chools there was alot of skills and the crusts those over and over that was like the firts hard thing they start with, that was alot of bad action they can choose but they don't choose any of those. Finally finish with right thing, Now is fancy work and alot oction to choose in life.                                                                                                          ",3.0

And i didn't get any thing from that class. Because the class was boring for me and very day works became alot so, unfortunately i drop my class. It is very different; when we are in normal class or we are in online class. Because in normal class, there is a teacher, students and a lots of things to they can make class very easy for students.

"Some schools thinks that students should attend classes at home. Others might think that attending classes at school will give benefits to the students. Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more subjects than online classes. If students does not attend classes at school there would not be teachers and staffs at the school.

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more of other subjects. If a student takes classes at home they would not be focusing on their assignment. They going to be on their phone, TV, or other type of devices. There will be no one supervising the students at home. They need teachers to teach them, educate them, and motivate them to learn. Attending classes at school as you can see will benefit the student..

In addition, If the students does not attend classes at school there would not be no teachers and staffs at the school. Many jobs will be lost due to students taking classes online. Plus, the students needs to build a relationship with the teacher and staffs. Online classes would not teach a student face to face, It would be better If a teacher teaches the student face to face.

Many people may argue that students should take classes online instead of going to school. People think that online classes will give the student benefits. They also think that the benefit of taking online classes, is to give the students more opportunity to learn. In the other hand, they are people who also believe that taking classes in school is better. Schools are meant for students to learn on other subjects.

"Online Learning

Who doesn't want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when they're in their house, students can't have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home.

Losing focus has a big impact in learning. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. I responded back to Generic_Name's text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight. This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher.

Secondly, taking classes online doesn't just mean you don't have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one.

Finally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. You can't always depend on your computer, not just the computers but even people aren't perfect. Another main problem Generic_Name had when attending classes online was his laptop and network connection. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties. When his laptop wasn't functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time. Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone.

In conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning.    ",5.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Distance learning students attend classes on time by online. Distance learning students also attend to school everyday. By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere.

First, distance learning students attend classes on time by online. In many states students live far from schools. Sometimes they can't be on time because of highway traffic. Sometimes cause of bad weather you have to drive slow than speed limit. And you can be late for school. If they late in every first classes they might fail that classes. Suppose they use the online conferencing they can be on time in every classes.

Also, attend to school everyday. Even if you sick for a week you still able to attend to school everyday by way of online or video conferencing. If weather is such a bad you can't go out of the house still able to attend classes from home. Although none is home to drop you off to the school. You can attend school by way of online or video conferencing.

Then, By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere. You can join to the class even if you go to your friends house. Also if you plan to go out the state for few days you can attend to classes from there. Students can enjoy also they can study. They're able to work in online.

In conclusion, for online or video conferencing students doesn't need to worry about there attended. Distance learning students attend classes on time by online. Distance learning students also attend to school everyday. By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere.

"That some schools offer the option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that this option is a really good idea for the students. This option can benefit many students that cannot attend schools in the regular schedule. Many students don not have the resources, time or for others personal reasons to attend schools and this option can be helpful for them to finished the studies.

Online classes. This is one of the option for those students that want finished the schools. This option can help them. They can take the classes from theirs home without go to the school and according the time that they have. Time can be a really impediment to attend school, a lot students that leave schools is because they have to work after school and they do not have enough time to do homework or other school activities. They start falling their classes and at the end they diced to leave the school and go to work. Because they may have to feed their families. Family and money can be other reason why the guys leave school some of then came here and don not have any family. so they have to studied and work at the same time to get some money to sent back to their families. But now with this option they can continue with their studies.

The other option can be the video conferences. This option also is a good idea to keep studying. Like online classes this also you can take it from your home any time that you want or depend the schedule that the teacher give you. Because on this option you are going to be taken classes in real time with teachers, that you will see each other by camera. This option can be helpful because while you are taking the class, you can talk to the teacher and ask about something that may be confuse you, and keep practice with him like you was in a school classroom.

One thing that make this great is that wile you are studying you can keep work and doing personal activities that you usually do. and the good of this program is that not only work for young people, adult also can attend this courses and finished their high school. Because other reason why people leave school is because they are over age or too old to go high school. But with this option you do not have that problem because this involve all people.

As we know in this time more and more teenagers are leaving the school. Some of then because do not have other option and others just because they are lazy. But now that the schools are providing this option many student that left school and other people can be benefit with that, and be a easy way for a lot students to finished their studies at get a better future.

I think that if more schools provide distance learning as option for the student, more people can get involve and be benefit with this program, and get better opportunities on their life. Because now that the school are doing this is not excuses to not finished the school.                      ",3.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Many believe sitting in a classroom is better for students education, but others believe it more reliable for online or video conferencing. Distance learning won't give you the same benefit as sitting in a classroom. Its more reliable to sit in classroom because if not you could fail, system can shut down, and you'll be getting more physical help in a classroom.

Many like distance learning because it's more flexible, but because it's really flexible a lot of people have a higher chance at failing then passing. Imagine, a lot of people don't like waking up at six in the morning to get ready for school, so what would you expect from a student who stays home. He/she could wake up late and still miss there class which means they're missing the material and education they need. Others irresponsible students will forget about the class and they won't care on doing the work. They will have the mindset of ""it's online, i can finish it later"". Many student fail to do there work because of laziness and for being irresponsible. Especially, if the weather is nice outside many students tend to make plans and won't have the same attention towards school like before. In the other hand, if the weather nice outside and students go to school , sit in a classroom, in the afternoon they wll be able to enjoy the weather and get there work done..

Numerous of computer's systems shut down because of many different reason. If this were to happen to a distance learning student, they wouldnt be able to log in. Some systems take hours, day, and maybe even weeks to get fixed. Other computers have trouble accessing internet. Without any internet, no student will be able to do any online class or video conferencing. Another problem with computers are, that the power goes out. If you computer or any cellular device is not charged where would you be able to plug it in? How would you get your classes done? How would you turn the things you need in on time? These are a few question people dont stop and think about. Therefore, because of these troubleshooting problems it best to go in to a classroom.

All students have many different learning skills. Some prefer physical help instead of visual learning. Learning the material physically is way more reliable to learn easier and faster. Physical learning can help people get there work done faster, easier, and not get distracted by other things around them. Students can be more focused on their work and get it done on time. Others say the environment in which there in doesn't matter as long as there focued , but to other people it does matter. While students are at home they can easily get distracted and forget they have work that needs to be done. this will cuase many students to fail and would have to retake the course.

Attending to school can have a huge impact in your life.

Making a decision of taking class from home can make a huge impact in your life and the future. For example a high schooler that takes classes online that wants to be a history teacher they can struggle a lot because a video can't give you enough information, for you to know the story. a video only summarize the story comapring to when you're in class you can ask questions and also have more information from your teacher. Having a teacher explalining you everything and working with other students can help your grade and also your GPA for you to attened to good collages and be able to have a lot of advantages.

Students will have more benefits and advantages of learning the materials, if they atten to school. students will also have good grades and apportunities for them to get a scholarship and have a higher GPA that would help them attened the collage they want to go to. For example if students don't have a high GPA, the most common thing that would happen would be that they will be rejected by a lot of collages. Having a high GPA can help you get into good collages without having to pay and you can also earn money while you're attending collage. students will be able to graduate early from collage and with a really high degree that could benefit them by finding job where they start at the top like others professionals people.

Students will struggle a lot looking for collages that are not too expensive or collages that can help them save money. For example nova is an academic instutude collage that has a lot of benifits for students such as saving money for collage. Have apportunities of going to others university or instutudes where you can work as an asisting and get well paid. Nova can be very helpful institutude that students can attened to because they only attened to nova for two years. At nova they prepare students to when they are ready to move on to a four year collage but you need to have a good GPA and have all the requirements that nova asks for.

However not everyone agrees that atteneding to school is benificial for students. some students think that having to show up to school is a waste of time and that it would be better if they learn by looking tutorials on youtube or being able to attend classes from home. For example if students don't attened to school they won't be able to understand anything which it will cause them to stress out and make them give up on there dreams. students won't adchieve if we let them attend classes from home.

Student's will benefit from take the school classes at home instead of going to the school because they could work at their own pace. Student's dont have to wake up early in the mornings and be tried and if Student's come to school all tried they wont do the work most of the time. If the Student's take online classes then can finish anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete assignment. This way if student's are really sick and can't come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the student's keep on track with the class. If the schools did the online classes they wont have to be worried about snow days. A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot. Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. A other reasons this is good is that student's that dont come to school a lot can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. Student's would probably have better grades because they would be finishing the work. It would be easy the get help if the student's dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help. The student's can take brakes during this time so they dont tried of doing a lot of work. This can also help the student's with computer skill while doing online school. Student's would get better information while doing this and it will come a long way in the future for them. A other good reason is that the student's can show their mom or dad they did their work so they can do what ever they went after because most of time student's dont show their mom or dad that they have been doing work in school. This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning.

"Is attending classes from home by way online of videoconferencing a favorable method for students to study?

Attending to classes from home by way online or videoconferencing is not a highly recommended way to study, because students will not have the same learning that they have while they are at school. If attending classes from home becomes a common way to study, students will not have the opportunity to build strong friendships with the other students around them, nor with the teachers. Also is not a recommended way to learn because students may not take their courses serious as they do in school because of the instructions of their teachers, or the advice of the counselors, or administrators of school.

In the first place attending classes from home is not the same has being is school, because at school students take their homework, quizzes and exams more serious that they can do at home. When students are in class and they have any question about the topic that they are learning of the can freely ask their teacher and the teacher will give them a clear explained answer and examples in order for students to understand everything they are teaching them. In addition, if students attend to classes online they will not have the opportunity to stay after school for extra help, or to retake a quiz or exam, nor to attend to a learning center to have other students helping them with their homework; or to just study with the company of another student. As a matter of fact, student's grades will decay due to not having all their questions answered, and their problems being solved.

Secondly, if attending classes online becomes a common way to study, students will not practice their communication skills by not building relationships with their classmates, not discussing their concerns with their classmates, nor just having fun with their friends during lunch ship. They would not feel the same way because at school sometimes students get inspired by other students, they see other students not just as their classmates but also as their friends, they could even see each other as family, therefore, students with the time get to see the school as another home where they know they have people that could help them with school stuff, but also can give them personal advice, as counselors and teachers do. Moreover, when students are receiving classes online at home, they will feel bored, and also lonely because they will not have anyone to discuss their questions or doubts with. In addition, in our present a large percent of teenagers are dealing with psychological problems such as; stress, anxiety, and depression; being at school distracts teens from their problems at home or even at their jobs, and it is a great way to receive help and advice from people willing to help them; such as school counselors, teachers, and friends. Being in school is better rather than being at home alone just studying.

Lastly, attending classes online is not the best idea for students who tempt to not take their studies seriously. While they are at home they wont feel the presence of a teacher standing next to them telling them to get their work done, or asking them to pay attention, and to not fell asleep during class. Also they will not feel the obligation to do their homework, in order to turn it in the following day. When students have to work in groups they learn lots of things from the teammates that they did not before, is a awesome way to inspire each other, and also to have fun, as students see other students work hard for their goals they do it too; but if these students are working alone they do the complete opposite. Therefore, this kind of students will think that they can do what they want and they wont take their courses in the serious way they have to be taken.

In conclusion, attending to classes online is not a favorable way for students to learn because they will not learn the same way that they do while in school. The students will not work on their communication skills, nor their social skills. In addition, students will not take their courses with the grade of seriousness they have to be taken. ",4.0
"Schools offer different options of schooling, they have is Online School , Public School , Private School and also Video Conferencing . However taking classes from home wouldn't benefit students the same way Public School would benefit them due to the fact; Some students are visual learners, Students wouldn't have a big social life outside of their home , Students can slack on their own education an have no motivation and also they could be relying on Google answers when they don't understand the material.

Students have different methods to remembering a material they have learned. Everyone isnt the same, Everyone has their own different techniques; Some people may be visual learners, They need someone to be speaking to them explaining step by step and some students just like peace and quite to figure it out on their own. Personally I am a visual learner for every subject, I would need my teachers to give examples and to go over everything to me step by step to learn the material the teacher is teaching. My classmate, Generic_Name has a different opinion, Generic_Name needs a quite place to concentrate and to think about his work rather than a teacher talking the whole class period.

In Elementary , Middle school and High school they plan a lot of activities for the kids. Schools have dances, concerts and even field trips being home schooled you wouldn't be able to enjoy none of the fun activities the school would have planned for your classmates. Being home schooled you wouldn't have that "" high school experience "" everyone claims they love so much and would do anything to go back too. Being home school would also effect your social life for the real world. In school they might not have a class for communication but going to a Public schools does teach you how to speak up and communicate with other people you dont know and that would really be beneficial for the real world after school when you go into your career.

On the weekend I personally hate doing homework, I like to think of my home as a lazy environment for myself rather than another school place. I think if kids were to be home schooled they wouldn't be able to concentrate at home the whole time they are supposed to. There would be no consequences for the student as if when they aren't paying attention or just on their phones the whole time. There would be no teachers or administrators to be motivating the student to get to work, be on time or even get your'e grades up. Being home schooled and doing online school they would start getting on the wrong track after some time. If my house for me was a school environment i would procrastinate my school work so much like saying "" ill do it in 15 minutes "" "" ill do it the next 15 minutes "" and so on to the point i forgot because i have no motivation for my work.

Having no teachers or administrator around it would be easy to cheat. not understanding the material and not being able to ask questions your last resort is to cheat for answer. Students will find the answers then think they have a easy way out of online school by relying on Google answers. Students can also pay someone to be doing their work for them and manipulate other kids to agree and do the work for them. Students attending online school or homeschooling have a lot of ways to cheat for their classwork.

I disagree that home school or online school would be beneficial for students because they wouldn't be able to learn and understand everything and to being able to ask questions, Students wouldn't have a social life outside of their home and not be prepared to communicate with people outside in the real world, Students would't have any motivation for their school work and start slacking off and lastly they can find easy ways to get out of their own work and having it done without them actually doing any work.

"student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because its give you education when you not able to go school to get education,like handcart people who can't go school for study but they want to study,its give you education when you stay in home. people don't want to go school they can do distance learning. practically education which help to get success in our life. online and video conferencing help your education strong. you can ask any thing ,you can search anything which help to solve your problem ,which help to get you some knowledge.

student doesn't like to school because student are lazy. But if student are lazy and they dont want to go school for study distance learning help you to complete your education. now it is a 2018 lots techknowleg are made day by day which help you to get knowledge from different sources.

distance learning help to save your pocket money,if you go school to get a education you need a few money for lunch. Those student who have a car to go school ,they can save their gas money which help to save your money. those student who like to stay home and study distance learning help you. distance learning help you every single second of your life. if you go or move anywhere and there is no any school for study it help you to get knowledge about every thing.

YouTube and googal is the one of popular online and video conferencing in this generation because every body need YouTube for learning. A person who worked in hotel and he forgot the step how to make lamb meat. he was waiting 10 minute for his friend to get some clues but his friend didn't came to help him. he take out his cellphone and search in YouTube and googal. he found a lots of idea and clues to make lamb meat. those people who already graduated they also need a online educated because study and education was never ending.

some student are really talented from their childhood because they already entering the distance learning. this 2018 kids are really powerful mind. a kid who just 5 years old he already how you to used mobile,how to used computer,this types of education also know a distance learning but not given by school. school give a distance learning education not only for graduation, its give you education for whole life.

some people are blind,handicap etc Those people have really problem to walking , who can;t walk this distance learning help you every single movement of your life. these all are the benefit of distance learning which is provided from school. i am positive for distance learning education because it its best way of study theroritacaly and practically. sometimes doesn't have answer when you need but distance learning have a different types of answer form. distance learning t is not only for handicap people it is good and beneifitablefor everyone small kid to youngest people all over the world. so i am positive with distance learning.",3.0
"Online classes or video conferencing it is one of the many opportunities that some school offer, for those who have a full time job and they really have the volunteer to graduate but they doesn't have the time to attend to school,they still can graduate, taking online classes and complete the credits that they need...

for example: my bother is taking online classes because he works full time, and wants to support the family at the same time.

Students are going to be more than benefit because they will have the opportunity to finish their classes.

The program distance learning has many advantage:

the students will have more space and time to review the same, if they did not understood it.

they will have more privacy they will have a flexible schedule, and they can take the class when they want.

they will not miss any class for any weather changes, etc.

Personally I think that is a great opportunity for us, because if we are not able to attend at school, the school gave us the opportunity to take online classes that way we can finish our classes and to graduate, also it is not like that you have to be there an specific time.",2.5
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I agree with this statement i have three reasons why I think students should be able to attend classes from home. One reason is some students have a alot of responsibilities at home and sometimes students arent able to go to school. Some might have kids and they need to stay home to take care of there kid because nobody can babysit. That's really hard for a student to do. Trying to go to school and have a kid can be very stressful to the student.

My second reason I have for this statement is some students feel comfortable having class in there own safe environment where they feel comfortable and not anxious. There are some students that have anxiety and are not able to function in a classroom full of students that can be really hard for a person because its not easy trying to get your work done in a classroom full of students and dealing with anxiety. That can be very stressfull I feel like a student should comfortable in there learning environment because when they are comfortable they achieve better in there work. They can focus better and get work done and won't be distracted by anyone there's a lot of benefits with that. Parents would also agree that having ther child in a environment that they are comfortable in is the best way to keep there child focused and willing to pass there classes without any distractions that the child doesn't need.

My third reason i agree with this statement is students can feel more determined to do there work at home in a quiet place its very helpfull to the students needs to be sucssesful. Some students get distracted easily and can't in a classroom so attending class at home helps the student concetrate and perform better with there work.

Another reason is parents would feel comfortable with there child being at home doing school work where they are safe and focused on the right things which is school work. Some students find it easier to do things online than in a classroom so its all about personal prefrence and i agree with this because it could be hard trying to understand what the teacher is saying or talking about. It's good to have a sense of understanding when it comes to learning something that's very important for students.

My conclusion to this statement is that i agree and I think it is a great idea for schools to offer this to students because it gives students a chance to be at home and pass there classes with no distractions. It also gives them an oppotunity to sucsseed and graduate. I also agree about doing school online because some students find it easier and better than being in a classroom all day and not being able to understand the teacher. I also like this because you can do your class work where ever you are you dont have to be at home if you have somewhere to be you can take a laptop and do work. I think doing online class works for a busy students schedule its all around is a good idea and I am happy that schools are letting students do online classes its a big benefit for them that's why I agree with this statement.

"Imagine if you could do school from home and have time to relax or do more stuff. I would love to be studying from my house because I would never have any distractions, and I can just stay comfortable the whole time. People say online school is better than online school, but online school is more comfortable and nicer for students because they don't have to get dressed and ready just for school, they can take their time with the school work, and they have more time to do more stuff like get a job or play a sport.

A lot of students get stressed in the morning because they don't know what to wear for school. What if they didn't have to worry about that anymore? I don't like to get up just to dress and get ready for school. Online school, the type of school that students don't have to worry about what you wear or how people think of you because no one will ever see you. We all get lazy at some point in life, and we just want somethinh that will make us feel comfortable while studying.

All students get rushed because they have too much work to do, and sometimes, they don't do it on time because it's too stressful for them to finish it all. Online school gives you a long time to finish all your work and maybe a little extra time to relax. My friends and I are always stressed because of how much school work we have to do, but if we could do online school, it would all be so easy and less stressful. Online school is the best way to get time for all your work.

Everyone that goes to a school knows how hard it is to keep up with the work and what they do outside of school. Maybe it's a sport or a job or it could be both. It would be great if we all had that extra time to do all that without stressing. I rarely have time for school and work , but my friend, Generic_Name, does online school, and she has all time she needs to finish her school work, go to her job, and play lacrosse.

Some might say that going to a normal school is the best way to study; however, online school is a better and safer for students because they are able to take their time with the school work. they don't need to get up and stress themselves about what they should wear or how they look, and they have more time for other stuffthat aren't related to school like sports or jobs. How nice would it be if we didn't have to worry about any of these problems? Online school will have you relaxed most of the time.             ",3.5
"I don't think it's a good idea to work from home they're a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. They're different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didn't feel like getting up so early in the morning. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.

There are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.

I'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. They're a lot of reasons is to why I don't think working from home or working online is a good idea. You never know who your going to meet online. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.

My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help. Yes their will be some kids that will learn online and there won't be some people do work better with the person right in front of them.",3.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

When i was 15 years old, i broke my leg and that made me incapable of going to the school for 3 months, during those 3 months i didn't get any support to keep track on my classes because the school i was attending didn't had distance learning; Consequently, i almost failed my school year, because of this i support the option of having distance learning.

The fact that some schools have the equipment to offer distance learning is motivating, because it gives an opportunity to teenagers that struggle to get the education they need and this can be for several reasons that can limit them to get to their schools such as a medical condition, being isolated from their schools, or any circumstances that can happen during the school year; Furthermore, having distance learning as an option that is beneficial to the students and to the schools in general.

Students who are having problems to get to their schools, for factors such as not having money for the transportation or the schools are located too far from them, will benefit of having distance learning. For example, if a student can't get to his school because he can't afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems.

Students who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state.

For example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that can't arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school.

One of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several country's around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment.

On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice.

In conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student won't be able to assist to the school.",4.0

The school is necessarily and beast place in world. is that savety.

"Some school are offering distance learning ash an opportunity for a student attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. I think this would be a good idea because is offering a good opportunity for people that can not be able to attend the school during the morning for other occupation personal and give a chance to get the diploma .Also is good opportunity to the people the can not be able to attend classes because they work. Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school that's a lot of benefit for people that don't work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school.

Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason.

Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you that's helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home.

Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they don't have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work.

Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the don't have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they don't have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online that's going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .",2.0
"The option of distance learning can be helpful for students in many ways. Internet have the access of having to take classes online or communicating with a teacher. Students can get the same knowledge in school or in their house but easier. Bullying is the major problem in school;however, teachers can avoid bully by having the option of distance learning. Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job.

Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some student's lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives.

Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems.

It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work. Having to wake up at the morning it is a hard thing to do for the majority of students, not having a good rest at night can effect students by ,grades, not concentrating, falling asleep at class, not paying attention,always been tired,or skipping some classes can effect when they graduate.

In conclusion having the opportunity to do home school can make a big difference in a good way to the school and to the students education. That it is something that can be a easy way to learn and have the same knowledge like the other students, but in easier way. Internet have the access to many apps to help students can be a fun way to learn instead be sitting in a classroom for two hours. Students can avoid the fact that are some students that do not care at all and if they do not care about their live they are more possible not care about other student education. Going to school now it is something that some teenagers do not considerate important student can take any class online.            ",3.0
"Taking classes online or video conferencing is one of the best way to help students,who can not afford to go to college and for older people that couldn't get the chance to further their education because of their financial state. Financial issues has become one of the problem in this generation of mankind, whereby students either have to pay to live on campus or out of campus to further their education,which has caused a lot of students out of school dorms because, they struggle to pay for them. Most students have daily jobs to help them afford to pay the bills, based on their level of education. Working and schooling is a difficult task on students because, one have to make time for school and work to be able to make everything easier and stress free.

Transportation and parking space has also been an issue for some reason, why some students prefer to take online classes from home to prevent them from being late to class. Colleges with large mass of land may not have enough parking space for students and we also believe that, not every student own a car or any type of moving vehicle where by one needs to park. when one is being able to attend classes from home, they get the chance to begin their lesson anytime during day after a long stressful day.

Students benefit from being able to attend classes online from home because, they accomplish more and get worked done faster in due time. With less distractions, they understand and enjoy the lesson, it helps them concentrate and more focus on what is being taught to them. They get to ask questions online, they also get more time to go over the lesson again to the right state of understanding the lesson. Lecturers reduce a lot on online students with less work and projects for them to have be ready for other assignments being given to them.

Taking classes online or video conferencing gives one enough to take care of other things, to be on time for lectures, help other students that couldnt go to college to feel they also have the right to achieve their goal once in a life time and to help others without transportion save money and more organised and time managment.",2.5

"Last week, I had a math test on my first period. I prepared well for the test, but on that day, I woke up late, and I realized I got late for my school. I also have missed my school bus; therefore, I had to walk the whole way to my school. I was tired and tensed. As a result, I couldn't do well in that test, but if I was taking online class, I could take the test from home and be able to not get into all this trouble. Online classes can save us from getting into all this kind of problems and save our time also. Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because sometimes, students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class, actually students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities.

Those who believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons.

They say sometimes students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class. For example, if they get a project or assignment, some students may have trouble in understanding how to do/complete that assignment or sometimes, they might not understand a topic from a lecture in online class.

However, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time. For example, if I get sick, I don't need to miss school. I can stay at home and take my classes from home. Again, if I'm not at home or may be I'm at my relative's place or my friend's place, I'll be still able to attend those classes.

Also, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. One example is that, if I don't need to come to school to attend classes I would be able to make my own schedule and I can do my job for more hours in weekdays and save money for my college. Again, I can finish my school works quickly and take other courses which can help me in my future career or, may be I can do some other activities I like.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. Online classes can help us in many ways. Not only it will save our time but also it can give us opportunity to do a lot of extra activities and enjoy the day.",3.5

For example if you have a baby, you can take care of you baby, and they the classes olnine at home. Also, if you need to go to work, you can go to work and in your free time take the classes online. Another reason is that some students live far away from the school, and they do not have a car or transportation, is more easy for them to take the classes online in the comfort of their home. Also, if they are in a normal school and they want to keep learning by the summer they easily can take the classes online or the video conferencing. In my opinion I think that the classes online or the video conferencing can a lot of students, if they are busy or if they are interented in this classes they can take it too.",2.5
"I agree about that some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, the students can would benefit. One of the reasons are that I think this can be a more easy way for students to learn is because they cannot be distract to anothers students, so they can work with tranquility. Another reason is that the students can save a lot of time working online at home, because they don't need wait for the bus, or walk directly at the school.

For example, if you work at home, you don't need permission to use the bathroom, because you're at home, so you can use the bathroom anytime. Another example is that some times work in the school can be so noisily, also can be uncomfortable, but if you prefer to work online you get not problems because you can be more focus in your work, and also you can feel more comfortable working online.

Another example about why I think that working online is more benefit for students, is because they can have all the recourses, and tools necessary to work, also you cannot be feel bad about if you don't finish a test ,or a quiz at time in school, working online you ge all the necessary time to complete a test ,or a quiz, you can more time to do your homework, also you can eat everything that you want working online, in the school you cannot eat on classes time.

In conclution, working online is a more easy way for students to learn than working at the school, because had a good help and a lot of good reasons, and also a lot of good benefits. That's what I think that working online or video conferencing is a more easy way to lear for the students, and also I think is a big opportunity too.",3.0
i think it not good for students because it didn't help students learn and you have to do the work by self . I think that school is better because it teach you how to do the work and the teacher helps you on the work. online school is not good is because it didn't teach you and you might not know how to do the work for the class for online. you might ask people for help when you don't know how to do the work when your at school the teacher teach you how to do the work and gets you all the help you in class and and afer school too so you can get more help on the work and the missing work and wok and if you don't understand the lesson. you could ask your teacher for help and be ready for test and the sol. You will learn better in school then online school. School is better learn because the teacher are there for you if you need to talk to them or to get help in the work or to get more lesson and they give you a lot of time on work and give you time on the test and gets you ready for the sol. one examples that you get better learning in school and the teacher help you understand the work. second online school is tell you how to do the work and you have to find it out for yourself. ,2.5
"Hello, this is Generic_Name and i go to Generic_School. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. When online classes are providing the classes you need to gradute but its online and for free unless you are trying to take extra classes to gradute earlier. It will be all your responsablity.

Students that go to school. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. they care about how your nutriton is or if the food is fresh or not. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide.

Online or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. I personally know alot of people that care about what others think of them and if they have friends or not or would people judge them because of what their wearing. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. Students consider taking online classes people judge alot nowdays and if you arent smart enough you will get your feelings hurt and that might cause depression for some people which can affect the student life.

My position on this issue. this issue is very common and i hear alot of students considering taking online classes .I think students should go to school and learn there because their will be all the help they need. They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college.

go to school guys and stay in school.",3.5
"I am writing about should students work in schools or their homes. Most people think its best for kids to be in school than in their homes because it can help them in their social life, make friends in there world instead of being lonely. Even though lots of students like to work at home, I strongly believe its better to work at schools.

Students should have friends in there lives to be more social in the world. When I was younger I use to switch schools to schools then I went to a school called Generic_School I was the only new kid in school I had no friends I was the quite in class, then one day I join a club called book club we just read books and talked about what happen in them. Then one of the kids came up to me and ask what do you like I told him what I love like animals, sports. Those were the things we both like too he was my first friend in that school. Students should be in schools because they should be comfortable when meeting, talking with other students because they might have things in common.

At school students can help each other out in class if they dont understand something. For example, In history there are students that don't understand they would just sit in their seats and not ask for help. One day I saw a student frustrated with work so I decided to help him in America Civil War. When we took our test we both got A's. In my class students can be helped by fellow classmate or the teacher.

During school projects students can be in partners or in groups to get a good grade. In my science class we have projects to do we get in a group of friends to get a good grade and we see a student work by him self. When we got our projects back we got an A and the student got a B. This shows that in schools we should be with other students to bring in ideas, ways that others can't see.

In school you can be well taught and understand better when people like teachers, or other students help them. Its best for students to be in school rather than be home school.",3.5
"Would it be surprising to know if students to know that students learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible with it. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades.

One of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the student's schedule when it is time do some distance learning. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way.

When taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Learning from home doesn't have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teacher's teachings for six hours and have a limited time to eat and take bathroom breaks. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school.

There are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. People from different colleges don't go to student's homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need.

Students should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home. In the near future, school systems and all districts should provide distance learning.",4.5
"My mother always said, ""You will never learn if you stay at home, go to school to learn more things."" Math, English, history, and science are some classes that students need to learn. If students take classes from home, then student will not learn so they will not benefit from it. Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will gain less exercise, students will get less social communication, and student will be less focus.

Many claim, students will benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because they will feel more comparable. However,students will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home.

To begin, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. For example, Generic_Name, who attend classes at home before, said that he will get less exercise, now that he goes to school he gets more exercise than before. To further detail, two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, both attend classes at home before, they would both say that they would gain very little exercise before going to school. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise.

Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. For example,

Generic_Name, a girl who use to attend classes at home, would not communicate much with other students at first, after some time she is able to communicate with other students. To further detail, Generic_Name, would talk very little to other students because he use to take classes at home, after a while he would talk to other students. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication.

Lastly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will be less focus. For example, Generic_Name ,a student who attend classes at home, had to difficult time focusing on the lesson at home, some later she began to understand the lessons. To further detail, Generic_Name had a terrible time focusing on the lessons when he toke classes home, he said that his surrounding was very distracting. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from at because student will be less focus.

To concluded, student will gain less exercise, have less communication experience, and will be less focus on lessons are reasons why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. These three argument state why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from home. If students attend classes at home then student will not learn a home. There is one option: students should not attend classes at home.",3.0
"Having online classes could be so much helpful and easier for those kids who doesn't leave near the school, or doesn't own car, it could be helpful because student wouldn't had to wait outside for a bus to pick them up, or for someone to take them to school, it could be easier because they could finish their classes from their house they would just need any electronic device and a connection to WIFI.

By having online classes I think it could make students life much easier, because if they get sick they can still take their classes and they wouldn't have to worry about making other students sick and there would be less chances of getting sick by other student, student would not have any excuse for not taking their classes, taking online classes could also help those student who are always late to school because they would take their class from their house so any bad weather could not be an obstacle.

There are many good thing about taking classes online but there always somethings students would need to give in order to have this benefits and that thing is social life, many students would never see their friends again because everyone has a different mind no everybody has the same goals and not everyone likes the same stuff so in my opinion thats one negative thing of online classes, but there are always a solution the teacher could make a project that could involve working in groups and I think online classes could change students life.",3.0
"For my own opinion , I think most students that have problems at school should take online or video classes at home to make it easier for them to learn and study.

Most students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. Even if you don't have problems you could take online classes if you wanted too. You dont have to go to school and learn , you stay home and learn in the computer. Homeschooling and online classes could be different but the sames at the same time. Learning at home could be better for you. Because at school cause you dont have no one to bother you , or giving you bad ideas , or cause trouble at schools on you learning experiences.

Some students would have benefits from being able attend classes from home? Some benefits could be like. "" What if its a bad idea to do it ? "" , "" What if I don't do good at it ? "" or "" What if I can't do it at home or at school ? "". Some have different ideas that it could be better for them to learn. At school it mighty be different cause there a lot of teacher and students that be different than you. At online school your at home with your parents and siblings? ad have only one teacher that teaches you on the computer. Its your dession to choose school to learn or online whatever that you comfortable for you to learn.

For me if I could choose , I'll choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home. So for me to learn , is by going to public or private school are better for me to learn , educate , and socialize to others , its better for me.

So online classes are not for everyone. Like me I perfer going to school , not taking classes online. But what I say

"" whatever that make you comfortable for you to learn "". For me is going to school learn amd talk to other students. Wahtever you chosses for you to do then do it. Online classes are greate! but for dome people don't think so, So my option are both some students benifets to do online or some doing it school. ",2.5
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. How would this affect students? this can affect students because they can get distracted by video games or phones. The problem is that some students get online classes but they just want to sleep more and than they don't do the online classes work or they play video games. this is why this is a bad idea.

first, one reason of why online classes will affect students is the distraction, for example they can get distracted by video games very easily by a friend calling them to ask if he want play, or by get bored get the phone and see they instagram.

to continue, the second reason is because they get sleeping to late at night and wake up to late, for example they can get sleeping late at night watching TV or playing video games with they friends. Some might says that online classes can be beneficial for students, but they don't know if the students are really working in they online classes because the distractions of video game or phones.

So the problem are some students who only want the easy way for everything include school.

the online classes are a bad idea because the distractions like video, phones, no sleep during night, or instagram.

To conclude this theme, I just want to remain you if you are taking online classes or you go to school, please do your best to be successful in life.",3.0
"Do you think students would benefit from being attend classes from home? As you might students can do well working from home, or they can attend classes from school. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online, or video conferencing. Student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is not teacher help, and cheater.

To begin with, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is no teacher help. For example, Generic_Name is doing his work online and there is something that he not understand, he will need the teacher help,or the teacher explication on how to do it, all students need some times help for the teacher. In conclusion, students have to attend classes from school because the teachers can bring their helps for anything you not understand.

Secondly, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because they can cheat on. For example, Generic_Name is working on geometry and she don't know how to do parallels, the only way that she can work on it, is cheating, she can take out her phone and search the answer from the internet. In conclusion, students would not benefit to attend classes from home because they can cheat on it and not learn how to do their works by their self without internet.

Some people argue, the students need some extra help. This is true because students with 18 years old they want to left the school for help their family even if they don't want to left the school they have for work and get some money. students would benefit from being attend classes from home by way of online because they want to finish the school. however, the students need to work hard for help their family and finish the schools for a job more better and get more money.

In conclusion, all students can have the oportunity to finish the school don't care about how their finish, without the teacher help, cheating they have to finish for get better job.",3.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. It would help the students who had a bad experience at school. Students who are in their comfort zone will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. Some may argue that student should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students that are at home will most likely be distracted, and will not finish their agenda. Some students will have a hard time teaching their selves. Also it would not give the students, the chance of experiencing what it is like in school.

It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. Every students grew up differently, and also some other students have had a bad childhood experienced and it reflected on how they act in their current life, by giving them a chance to study where they are comfortable at would give them a chance to show what they can really do, because not many students have that many option or chances to show their full potential. They can not do that by having to stay in school, and force them selves to socialize to other students or teachers it would all just be a distraction.

Also, it would help the students who had a bad experienced at school. Students who experienced getting bullied at school can caused them to stop going or the will to study and be successful in life. Bullying even nowadays still have so much impact on why some schools are really not on their high standards. And it showed that students are highly affected by it. It showed that it is a nightmare to some students, but now having the online classes will pull them away from that and really focused on their studies.

Furthermore, students who are in their comfort zone, will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. By having that comfortless and being in your zone of learning, will highly benefit you to show your potential. Being in the right environment also help students focused. Students who is really serious about being successful and have that high standards are more likely to be successful. Family can also motivate them, to keep on pushing even though it might be hard for them but having your family by your side can really motivate you to keep on pushing.

Therefore, i really believed that, students should really have the option to take online classes or video conferencing. by just having that it would benefit lots of student, who are having problems being socialize to other students or teachers. it would help the students who had a bad experience in school. And it also would benefit the students who are in their comfort zone, and being able to focused and having that chance would increase the chances of more students will be successful.",3.0
"Great opportunities for students to attend to classes from home by online way,

Well, Now a day with the new technology. Thinks get easy every day, Long time ago you had to attend to a regular school because there was no other way to attend to school and accomplish your career dream, But now we have new technologies that allow some school to give online classes from home, If you live far away from school and theres no way you can get to school faster and easily. You don't have to worry at all, Because now there are a lot of online web site that can give you an opportunities to you to accomplish your goal or your professional career, so I think this is a great opportunity for all of those people who never went to school and think is too late, Well is not, Online classes allow to accomplish their goals to every one, No matter what age if they are old or young they can do it whenever they want, And at the time they are available,

However, Some parents decided to enroll their children in a online school, Because they think thats better then to sent they to a regular school, In one point those parent are right because in a regular school you are not looking out their children, And they dont know what they are doing, Or even if they are in school or not, And also you dont know what class of friend does your child is hanging out with, Or if other children are bulling to your children,

In regular school you don't know whats going on,

But. by the other head in home school you can be with them during that time they dedicate to study, or even better if your schedule don't fit with the time they need to study, you can hire someone you have confidence with, To help you, In home school your child is not surround of bad children that can make your child feel depressed, So in this way you can see how your child is going in progress,

And I think this is one of the best decision you can take to enroll your child in a online school, Or even your self if you want to get your education higher, I think this is a big opportunity not just for child but for adults too, This schools online bright us a lot of benefices, For example those people who didn't finished their studies is not too late to continued, This benefices them because they can do it at the time they are available, And in a comfortable place, In my position I'd rather enroll in myself in online classes.

"Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some parents think it is a good idea for students to stay at home for education. Students should not attend classes from home. Here are the three reasons why students should not attend classes from home.

The first reason is students are just wasting time at home doing work, but they are really just playing video games or watching T.V. Also Most of the students that are home schooled can easily get distracted from Cellular devices too. What if the students have siblings, they might not have the time to do there work on time. Students at home may not have any connection. So, students will not be able to do any homework.

The second reason is students can struggle with homework. Students can focus on doing there homework or class work. But what if students are blind and can not do any work at home. If a student is blind, parents would have to hire or contact someone to help that blind student at home for some help. A student from a different country may not speak English. That also can be a struggle for a parent or gaurdian because they might not be able to afford classes at home.

The third reason is wasting money on books or classes. Most states have classes for free books or classes, but some other states might not. Parents might have not have the money for the classes or for the books. But wasting money on classes or books is not a good idea. Parents have to pay bills but what if the student needs the money for the classes.

Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home or by video conferencing. Parents may think it is a good idea for students to stay home for education at home. Students should never attend distance learning for there education.",4.0
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? In my opinion, I dont think the students would benefit taking classes at the comfort of their homes. That is because it's not the same thing as going to school. Taking classes at home is not the same as taking classes in school because in school you have a teacher that can help you, if you don't understand what's going on in the class. Also another reason is that in school you have a teacher that can teach the student actual lessons that the student can benefit from. Third reason is because sometimes you will just be lazy and not do the work and just do whatever you want since you're at home. No one will stop you, or give you remainders to do your work. Overall, I don't think the students would benefit from taking classes at their homes.

I would think that online classes would be harder and difficult to understand. In fact, being in a normal class you learn more and you are all catched up with your work. Being in school will help you communicate more with others, you can make or meet some new friends,the teacher will help you with some work if you need it. Online classes are harder because the student might not know what to do and he/she will be lost. Some people might find that online classes are hard and some might not it just depends on the individual. Some people just learn differently.

In conclusion everyone is different. What might work for you, might not work for the next person. Some people might benefit from talking online and some might not it. Honestly it just depends on what the students perfers online classes or school classes. I think that taking class in school is way better, teachers help you, you get better knowledge, you communicate more with others. Overall there is no right or wrong you just pick what you learn best and just do it.              ",3.5
"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you won't have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls aren't great because most people aren't paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you won't meet any people and you won't learn how to socialize at the end you won't learn how speak to people.

The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school.

To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you aren't at a on campus school,You're grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you don't go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. It's not fun staying home

With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day it's still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they aren't doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education that's not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they aren't using there whole brain to do they're work. One of the major reason why online classes aren't good because you can just google the answers that's just cheating you aren't learning it's cheating.

Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students don't listen or even look at the screen to the call. It's just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you won't have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldn't need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education.

The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they won't be able to anything for the future for there education because they didn't pay attention or learn it well plus they won't have any friends to know them.

"Schools were made for people who wants to learn and be a successful person in life even though , there are some people who don't have the opportunity to be in school. Right now in some countries be on school until you are 18 is a law but it other countries government those not care about children future. Here in the United States they have the option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. They have that option specially on universities because some universities are out of the city and a percentage of students with a bad economy may not be viable to get transportation everyday. So In my opinion that is a great idea to have that option on universities. They should have the same option in high school but not to all the students because that may cause students to fail the classes. High school 's should give that option to students with excellent notes and for students who live out of town. Attend classes from home by online or videos has benefits, oneis you become more responsible,

second it helps you to earned money, and gives you more opportunities to success.

In one hand,Attend classes from home it may be a big responsibility because you are doing it by your own no one is going to help you or push you to learn. For example when you attend to class in a school or colleague there is always a teacher ,who is there to help you,supports you ,and make sure you don't fail your semester, they also make sure that you are learning and getting better everyday. Instead when you have to attend classes by yourself you must be confident and responsible to make sure that you are going to take classes everyday and don't waste the opportunity,because no one is going to be telling you more than 3threet times to do you work .There are some students that don't know what be a responsible person means, does students may not be viable to get good greats by taking classes from home. This kind of students need help from someone to push them and teach them to be a responsible person. Be a responsible person is important because it helps you to success in life gives more opportunities and you don't depend from nobody you learn how to do things by your own.

In the other hand one more benefit to attend classes by home in online it helps you to earn money specially if you live in large distance from school. A few houses are located miles away from the city that means schools are located miles a way from home. In that case attend classes from school it would be very helpful and a big opportunity. Because take transportation everyday Monday to Friday it may be expense because you may pay at mornings to get to school and pay back in the afternoon to go back home. One more benefit is that it help you to success,you may be a viable to find a job. For example you can do your online classes in the mornings and find a part-time in the afternoon. Many students do this they go to school on mornings and work for a couples of hours at night. But if you could attend classes from home it would be so much easier to work and study at the same time you would made your own schedule withou a problem. Also make sure to give enough of time to do your online classes and get good greats.

In conclusion

I do believe this potion to attend classes from home in online or videos is a great opportunity. Specially for students who live out of the city and for everyone who was to success in life no matter what. School and universities should let students know about this option. I am agree and I believe that I may not be the only one who support this idea. Therefore this opportunity should give to students who really needs it and no to those who would waste it .This kind of option should be in all over the world to help people with bad economy and help those who want to success and have a passion to learn. Students who have the opportunity to attend school everyday without a problem should know that there is people that live far from the city that they would love to be seated in a classroom and attend school everyday.

"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. That might a good idea for some students but not all. Today, many High Schoolers from the age of 15 to 18 have jobs. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. Going to work after school is very overwhelming. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. That goes on days after days. Many students can get stressed out easily. So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready early in the morning to go to school. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasn't even risen and frezzing weather outside. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. You could ask the teachers directly if you don't understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. So in the bottom line. I think it's better to combine both ways. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. They can take classes online since they can't make it to school. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. They can stay home and attend classes online. Or only apply on seniors. Because it's their last year and they have lots of work to do. But in my opinion. Attending clases online or directly at school don't matter. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.          ",3.5
"In some schools think that attend classes at home is most better ;The fifty percent of the schools think that attend classes at home is not productivity. Some people might say that taking classes at home can't benefit students because when their need help or have some question any teachers can be there ,taking classes at home can benefit students because their can have more time to sleep and their don't need to take a bus or walk.

In the first place ,attend classes at home can't benefit students because when their need help or have some question any teachers can be there. For example , I have a cousin who take classes at home but he never know anything because no body can help him when he have a question. While, always I tell him that if he have a problem I can help him or another option is that he don't taking classes at home anymore. Also he don't make friends because he do not go to the schools. I choose this option because a lot of student waste their time taking classes at home. I am agree that attend classes at home not have benefit.

likewise, attend classes at home can benefit students because their can sleep more. In my case, if a have the opportunity to take classes at home i'm happy because I love sleep a lot. For example,the twenty-five of the student get classes at home because don't like to make a friends or their believe that their can do the work along. The classes start early so in this way they do not have to wake up early. Also, if people sleep more their can be more healthy this is the reason because student like to take classes at home to be more healthy. I choose this option because is important remember that many students want to sleep more or get extra time because their have a job and is hard to them do two thing at the same time .For this reason many student choose take classes at home.

In addition,attend classes at home can benefit because student don't need to take bus or walk. For example,some student do not have to take bus because are more near to the school. In my case, I have to walk from my home to my schools sixteenth minutes every single day. when winter come and is so cold outside it's not good to walk in this temperature. while , this is the reason because students take classes at home although sometime can't benefit. Another reasons is that some students have to take the public buses so is take classes at home don't have to take bus. I choose this reason because many people forget that many time is not easy for the students do that.

Finally,everything have advantage and disadvantage because some schools think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home and some schools are disagree. Also some students work a lot so their can benefit with this opportunity. Although, attend classes at home is not the same thing like go to schools and receive help from teachers, students, etc. In addition, if some schools offer this opportunity have to think about it and look the best option.",2.5
"SOME SCHOOLS OFFER DISTANCE LEARNING AS AN OPTION FOR STUDENTS TO ATTEND

CLASSES FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE OR VIDEO CONFERENCING. DO YOU THINK

STUDENTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO ATTEND CLASSES FROM HOME:

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Parents do not want their children to attend classes from home. Students will not get much benefits, whoever if they live in a place that is far away from school or they can't attend school for any reason then its has benefits. I'm not agree that students should attend classes from home because students can have stress, students can not pay attention very well, and the most important fact is that it will affect on students' grades.

The first reason is that the students can get stressed everyone time whenever they attend the class online because i know that its not easy to take classes online. students have to pay more attention. They can not understand very well by online or on video conference. It will be hard for students to learn or to understand their lesson online. Students will be stressed out because no one will be there to help them, not any teacher and either any friend (any other student).

The second reason why students should not take classes at home is that they will not able to pay attention by taking online classes. it does not feel like the school environment. students will spent more time on their school. At least in schools we pay more attention than doing our homework at home, because we mostly spend our time on our devices (cell phone) and on the television by watching episodes, cartoon movies, other movies, and etc.

The third reason is that it also affect on students grades and in the future they can not attend their favorite college. They won't able to understand the lesson, they will get bad grades in all subjects. It is so important to attend the classes at school, then you will know what is going on. students can ask teachers if they are having problems in their lesson. teachers can help them during school timing or after school. It will be easy for students to understand or to pay attention and they can get good grades too in all their subjects.

Students should not take classes at home. It will affect on their grades because they will not able to pay attention, they will get stressed out because if student need help, no one will be there to help them for their studies or their lessons, and it will be hard to pay attention at house by doing online studies.

"Students won't benefit from being able to attend school from home. Students will slack and become less responsible if they are home school.

Students tend to postpone work and project since there isn't a teacher physically in front of them constantly reminding them ""do your work"" or ""heads up this assignment is due next week.""

Although some may say students benefit more being home schooled they won't because they will get comfortable. Students will have the sense that they can do the work whenever they want , so therefore they won't complete the assignment. Students will later find all the amount of assignments that have to be complete will increase the student will feel overwhelmed then later fail, quit , and drop out.

School prepares you for the real world. They take in consideration attendance and responsibility. For instance a job as well requires these characteristics. If your home school your not training yourself or the mindset to adjust to being responsible. Home school will make someone ,less responsible since they got into the habit of being comfortable and not responsible.

In conclusion students won't benefit from being able to attend school from home. Students will slack and become less responsible.     ",3.0
"In my opinion, the students tanking to attend classes from home, by way of oline or video conferencing. I think the students not have benefit from being able to attent classes from home.

First, the students has more distraction in home; with vedeo play, and othe oction, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a classes in distance, the schools need a tanking a other options. With lern in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learnig more specific, when she tanking the classes to has a more effective for a students.

Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home; not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wich learning in home.

In finally; with reason with not is good idea the learning a distance the school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking the video conferencing online, because; learning more in the watch the vedeo conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a students, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Conclucion; the students not taking the classes from the house or distance learning, but students learning more when she go to the schools. The parents thinks exactly whit me, because is most effective taking the classes in the schools, in not a distance the schols. ",2.0
"Does taking classes from home benefit students.

People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids don't learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.

Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why

I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it .

Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition.

First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.

Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.

Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.

in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it.

When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isn't going to help you. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but. If you know your kid is at home working and you see that he wants to learn the don't listen to the rest of the people.",2.5
"They say some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. I agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because some students rather attend to a class at home than at the school so they can focus more; However, some students suffer from bullying, and they rather stay at home and study than attend to school and get bullied again and again. Attend to school at home is a different type of learning is at your own place you got peace.

Attend to school at home is different when you talk about focus, at home, you at your own place quiet, you don't have people around you to stop you or distract you. One day at high school I was trying to focus for a test retake but I coudn't because my friend kept distracting me and that made fail my retake. If I was at home learning in peace without distractions maybe I would pass the test. The point is that studying at home is quiet and calm what can help you successfully at your school grades.

One of the biggest reasons students attend to classes at home is due to bulllying every high school students suffer from bullying whats is wrong but we can't change people we got sometimes you got to change your strategy so you can live a healthy life, thats why some students decide instead of getting bullied every day attend to school at home. I had a problem at freshman year that i've got bullied every time because of how skinny I was and I was kind sad, all my grades went down and I didn't knew what to do;Therefore, if I decided to attend school at home I woudn't have to face this problem every school day. In this case being abble to attend school at home helps a lot of students.

Allthrough, attend school at home got some issues too, when you attend school at home you don't socialize, you don't get to know a lot people, One of my favorite soccer player once said that ""the only thing that attending school at home does not help is at socializing, meeting new people."" that's of the reason not a lot people attend school at home, because they like to meet new friends, being together with people that you like.

Therefore, students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, you can focus more and you is a option that you can take if you have any obstacle in your way at school such as bullying or something like that, nowadays is more common to see people taking online classes. All the schools should have online classes that you can take at home so every student can study the way they want to study;Therefore, students benefit by being able to attend classes at home.",3.0
"Attending school and Attending online classes.

Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing is not a really smart idea. You can learn better by making eye contact, and asking questions from the teacher rather, than just trying to learn online. Education is one of the most important things in our life that we can't continue it in a good way by attending online classes. Attending online classes might look a smart idea for some learners because they might be able to stay home, and study, but there is absolutely a reason that we build schools. Students might get benifts by attending online classes, but not as they will by going to school. Attending school instead of attending online classes have a lot of benefits that can change an idea of attending online classes.

Attending school can give us a freindly character by being able to talk in front of a group of people. When we attend school, we start talking, and communicating with people by the time we get in the bus. We can find freinds, and get help from them when we need. We will be able to ask any question from the teacher at any time that we want, and they can give us the answer without waiting or searching it online. We will get ready for bigger communities such as college and university by attending school. Teachers don't just teach us a lesson, but they show us how to talk in a good way, and how to have a good character in our life. which online classes would't help us in such a way. We will have a lot of events at school that we can celebrate with the whole school. We can't celebrate any event while attending online classes.

Our chatacter, and the way we are is really important, and attending school will help us to have them in a best way. Talking, and asking questions in front of the whole class or several classes will help us a lot to get ready for college, and more other presentations. Comunicating is something that we will need to use in every day of our life. School is the best way to learn how to comunicate. When we go to college or university there will be a community bigger than a school. Therefore, attending school is a very good option rather than attending online classes. School is not just a place to study books, but its a place where we learn how to live like an educated human. Friends are like family. while we are attending school we will make a lot of freinds but we can't make any freind while attending online classes. Celebrating some events will give us the best memory while we can have that by attending school but not online classes.

Attending online classes have a lot of disabilities to teach a student they way they need to be teaching. A teacher can show us how to use a good language with other people but an online class wouldn't be able to do that. A big community like school can make us get used to talk in front of a group of people, while in online classes we are alone. We need courage in order to study. When we answer a question in the class or get a good grade in our class, the teacher, and students courage us but if we get a good grade in online class, there is no one to see our talent and courage us wihtout a small class massege. Attending online class might be good for some reasons. When we are sick or we have a poblem that we can't go to school; attending online class will help us, but not for a long time. Video conferencig has a big different with wactching what the teacher does in class, and what questions students ask.

There is a lot of ways that we can study but, attending school is the best way. Attending school is a complete education than other ways. we build schools because we can understand the importance of studying at school. School is a place where we start how to to earn someting that we want, and teachers help us with that by giving us courage. Attending online classes will just help us read something, and if we don't understand a word, then we need to search online for that either, whcih is going to take longer time than studying at school. I strongly prefer attending school than attending online classes because there are many benifits we can get by attenidg school rather than attending online classes. We can not learn all the good things on online classes that we can by attending school. Attending online classes will be a big process, diffuicult, less apportunties, and there is no one to encourage us or show us what is good for us. Attending school is a best way to have a bright future, a good way to communicate and a good preperation for college and bigger communities.",3.5
"Yes i think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home in the way that they can be more ready to start the class, and they will focus.

-The reason why i though that is because sometimes at school the students they have shame to show to other the best of them, "" the intelligent student told me that i can't do anything or i can't speak very well English"" still if we want make our goals we can do it. Without go to the school.

-For example:

If a student is on his house alone with no one told him what or how he need to do the correct things, but he has a lot of question about what he is doing in his online class. He will try to find the way to solve the problem by himself.

Also if i was in my home find new imformation and i work to much during the day then i would be hungry then i can go to the kitchen for cook something very fast and go back to my room continue with my homework. And if i have a question i will ask for help to some teacher by texting.

Eventually, attend classes at home with no pressure could made different and confortable for the students who are shy or maybe need a teacher only for one student for explain the class that the student is taking. Below for those students that don't like to wake up too early in the morningt they have the choose to study more later since at night without necesary be ready for school. Many cases when girls are pregnant they can still going at school, but it was diffult for them had to continue study and also after that they giving birth too. i know that because a friend told me and another girls too, she told us the process that she has to pass during her pregnancy and after when she has her baby with her I don't know how hard it is, but i can imagine in this position. So what my friend do? during her pregnancy she still coming to the school i saw her many time she was so tired with her belly and then when she has her baby yet she take in her house the next classes i was surprise about it either i do not how unconfortable it was for her that a teacher was with her when the baby start cry or when the baby need to eat, later she was done she back to the school but she didn't feel ok for leave her baby at home. This story make me think about it if i have the election to choose how i can study i prefer study and take the classes in my house better that school.

I think the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home that's great idea. but there are many problems; what happen if the student do not have money to pay the online classes? either their families do not have the recourses for help them another reason that's why we have to work and make money for us and we missing many days in the school for stay at home because we want sleep more hours or we coming to the school and we are no pay attention what the teacher is talk about the class, So i think this if a student want money need to work and continue study online maybe in that way is more easy pass the class and the SOL. Attend classes from home by way online help this type of case the students go to work few hours and then coming home for the rest of the day to study or another option is one day work and the next day don't and stay at home taking the online classes, in summary ""NEVER GIVE UP"" when we want something that we can't get it in nowhere only in our effort we can make that possible. Also with some help ask when we do not understand something and put the best of us all including: try to solve the problems, research good imformation, and the most importat thing that we have to do is study. sometimes the other people make feel us so bad or without no reason to be in this world, go ahead and desmostrate to that person who do not believe in you that you can do it.

During school year is possible learning for online or video conferencing,in the videos explain clearly what or how to solve math ejercise or another kind of materials. Examples of benefit to attend classes at home are:

- Spend more time in the computer

- More focus in the homework

- Use the iphone for imformation whenever we want

- Study all the day

- No talk with your friends during your class

- Finish more fast with no distraction

All that things are benfit if the students being to attend classes in their home in the winter they don't have to worry about how cold is outside in the morning or what clothes is appropriate for school, and have to coming in the school in a good mood for study and see somebody that we do not want to see and prevent be involve in problems with another student. Could fine stay at home by self in own class than go to the school. Many student suffer of depreciation and that is so bad for them. If they school giving to them the opportunities to take the classes online it is more better for their healthy, this is my opinion about attend classes on the home.                ",3.0
"Students would benefit from being able to attend a regular school more than an option for students to attends classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students will learn more if they go to a regular school and they can help them self to be active in school or participate from sports, club member and etc..

Students would benefit from being able to attend a regular school because students will learn more if they go to a regular school and students can do more better or focus if they're in the regular class/school and they can ask for a help from their teacher or their classmate. The most important in a regular school is that you can ask your teacher face to face about your grade or your missing paper works on her/hes class. For example, Sarah is more likely to attend on a regular school more than an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because Sarah is more having fun to go to a regular school to see her teacher, classmate, and her friends everyday. This proves that Sarah is glad that she improve herself for everything especially for all her achievement in her life as a student.

Students would benefit from being able to attend a regular school because they can help them self to be able to improve them self to be active in school or participate from sports, clubs member and etc... Being a students you need to enjoy your life as a high school students because once you graduate or go to college you my not or my regret yourself for not trying/try to involve yourself to join some sports or clubs member etc.. For example, Enrique love to play basketball went he was a child until he's grow up, but he never try to involve he's self to join the basketball team went he's on high school because he always said that he's not enough or not that good to be part of the team that's why he never try to involve he's self at least one. This prove that involve yourself to any sports or clubs saw you will not regret yourself at the end.

Some people say it's better for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. 35% of many students agree with that because it's boring and they can't focus on school and they have a work that's why they pick to attend from home by way of online or video conferencing. 65% of it will not agree with that because if you do the home online class i think you did not give your best or your not more focusing on your classes online. 65% people said that if you really want to be successful person you need to proved your education, education is the key of your life. This prove that you need to choose Wesley for your self, not only for your self for your parents also.

"Do you think students should have online classes at home? Do you think this will benefit the students in their life? In this paper, I will argue that students should not get online classes.

Students should not get online classes at home, because some students have to work and they are too busy to take online classes. Some people do not go to school, but they take online classes. some students work at night and they do not have time to take online classes. Students should not take online classes, because schools are for learning and home is for students to have fun, relax, and do what you want to do. Students should not take online classes, because they need to enjoy their free time while they are not in school. I do not want to take online classes, because I work at night and I do not have time to use online classes. My friend takes online classes when he is at home, but online classes took some of his free time.

Some people say, that students should have online classes because they need to focus in school and that they should start planning what they want to do when they are grown up and out of school. They are wrong, because life is not just to focus on what you want to do when you finish school, is to enjoy it and do whatever they want to do in their life. Some people want the best for their kids, but life is one and they should enjoy it.

I think in the future some students will go to school and do online classes in their free time, so they can focus on what they want. Some students will go to school, but they will not do online classes because they want to have a good career, but they do not want an excellent life like the other students.",3.5
"There are many students that has the possibility to take class at home. The students that take class at home are benefit because they don't need to leave from home, they can stay in home if are sick, and they can't be absent, because they always stay in home.

There are many reasons for explain that takes classes from home is a good idea, this are some of them:

First, the students that take class at home don't need to leave from home, nothing can detain take classes. The weather changes don't affect to take a class, if is snowing, raining or are a hurricane in the city.

The parents of the students that take class from home can be more unsuspecting, because they sons are in home, also this is benefit for the parents of students that take classes from home; they can be sure that nothing danger can be happen to they sons. The student don't have any excuses for be absent. This is good for the students because they at final a year has perfect attendance.

Second, the students that take class at home just can be absent, if they need to stay in home and don't take some class, they have the opportunity to explain to the teacher by text or just a call, then the teachers need to ask to your parents if is necessary don't take classes because you don't feels good. The students that take a regular classes in the schools can't do this because they need to be in the school everyday , if not in this case the correspondent sub school has the obligation to put absent in the class day.

Finally, the students that take class at home can't missing a class, they don't have the possibility to missing the bus or miss some useful for the school. The students can't forget the computer, pencil, notebook or other things that we use in school, because they have all classes online, this can be positive for the students that stay in home at care to they parents the student can't has some distractions that sometimes has in the school, like talk with any friend, use a inappropriate language to the teacher or don't pay attention, if can be some possibility to the student miss some class; they can take the missing class latter.

In conclusion, take a classes from home is a good choice because stay in home, do not have any absent if are sick, and don't missing class, are a good idea for take classes at home, the benefits that this have are good for parents and students that need to have more family time, or need to have more time with they sons. A reason that take classes in the schools take a big part time of students, this is a good choice because the students don't need go to the school just stay in home ,add that, this is a good choice for some students that need to stay in home, with they brothers or they parents.",3.0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

In my position I think it's a great idea to attend classes from home only if you work, or if you can handle any type of work by yourself without a person that will persuade you to do the work, and if you know English perfect.

I think that some students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because for some students it's difficult to wake up early because some students who work on

Part-times, and some students don't want to wake up early, or they go to bed late for playing games on their phones.

Secondly. I think that some students might benefit from this program if they can handle any type of work independently without a teacher or any person persuading them to do the work, because some students are smart and they like to work independently, in silence, without people disturbing thems or without too much explanations.

Also. I think that the only students that can understand any work and can only attend classes from home, are those who knows English Perfect, because if you know English perfect then you can work in any topic or subject without the help of anybody, If you are a Hispanic born in other country then this program it can work for some Hispanic students because they are used to get everything easy, to get what they want without making a effort.

In the other hand, I think that this program it won't help to those students who distract easy or those who don't do work without any person who will persuade them to do the work, because there are students who likes everything easy, students who don't want to make an effort, this program it won't work to those students who don't like to study, to those who have only F on their classes or those who are skipping, or not going to school.

In conclusion I think this program can only help those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person. and for those students who have dreams, those who makes a effort to get what it can help thems in the future, for those that knows that life it's not easy, to those students that know that if you don't work for it you won't get what you want on life. those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person.",2.5
"Today schools offer many tools or ways to complete your diary learning process. one of these tool is called ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"". Basicaly students can complete all their schoolworks and learning process at home through different methods like, in this case, the students attend classes form home by way of online or video cinferencing, but is it really good for the students?. Probably not.

It is know that students learn how to be sociable at school, and also they learn how to act at to many different social events or situations in the daily life. For example, we have a group of students, they are all the day working in a classroom with other students and friends that they knew at school; and we have a group of students that take ""school at home "", they do their school work in their houses and they just can socialice with they family at home. How can you learn how to be sociable without socialice with new people? different than your family ?. The answer is: you can't. Talk with new people improve you confidence and helps you to make new friends, and as students or young people, we do not used to try to talk with new people, because we are afraid, we don't have self-confidence, etc. and school force us to be social with our partners.

Moreover, some people claim that school is not a good way to improve your social abilities, but that people passed and important point and is that the school is the best way to improve your social abilities. For example, you (as a student) are working from monday to friday at least six hours per day with other students and teachers in different classrooms, the students aren't going to be the same in each classroom. All these factors made you get used to different personalities or behaviors of your teachers, friends, and classmates. School have to many different people with different behaviors that can help you to understand the way that people act and how to be their friend.

In addition, school teaches you how is going to be your life when you grow up and trains you for that. There are to many similarities between school and a job, for example: the schedule that makes you get use to the early woke ups, the homeworks that make you understand how long can be a job journey, and the teachers and students that represents your boss ans partners at work. All these examples of how school trains us for our future. Without all the training that the schools gave us, it would be a problem to get use to or daily life when we grow up.

All these reasons show us that school will benefit students more than ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"", because it teach us how to be sociable, it develops or social abilities, and it is a necessary part of our training for our adult life. In conclusion, school trains us as people, it teach us how to socialice and work.",4.0
"I agree that the option the some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says ""distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing"". I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you

Some benefits that students will have being in this program are the food and transportation. Let's say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. Another thing is the food. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want.

The benefits that you get does not end there. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that. Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you.

There still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. Like for example let's say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. Taking classes at home take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do.

Concluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways.

By taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job. As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students.           ",4.0
"Here is my three reason why student should not go online do the classes work at home.

My first reasons:student should not do there classes from home.

Because it can be hard doing you work at home it batter do the work at work because you can get help by the teacher at home no one can help you. It can be hard to do the work from online because you don't know what the teacher can gave to you i will rather do it at school because it will be easy to do the teacher can help you with it will be hard try to do you classes work online at home.

My seconds reasons:student who are smart should do there classes online at home.

Student who pass the SOL and the class they should get out early from school because people who have a job they should get out early from school. Student should have a high GPA so they can find a collage they want to be they have to think what they want to be when they finish high and collage so they can have there own business person and make money. People who is smart should not go to school because they already pass every they did.

my third reasons:They should make classes work online only for the kids.

Because it will be easy for them to do they classes work online. They should make classes online only for kid it will easy fro them do it it at home batter then school but some parents they want there kid to go to school and do the work at school. If they school do classes online for kid it will be easy for teacher and for the kid.

My finial reason:For school offer classes online at home.

I think all high school student should have classes online at home because it will be easy for student and for the teacher. If student have classes work online at home they can copy from his friends that why is not good to have classes online. Middle school should have a classes work online at home.

summer:

Collage should have online classes becuase it will easy for them do complete the classes online at home they will have time to do it and get a batter garde so you can complete the classes and take a new classes when you get A or B.",2.0
"Distance learning is a great option for students to attend classes from home. There are many students that fail the grade just because they don't attend their classes at school. This is a great way for students to still take classes and learn more their education. The generation from now aren't as motivated as generations before. Theres might be a some people that wont agree with this statement because they probably think going to school is better than taking classes online or conferencing from home.

Some people may say that it isn't a great idea for schools to offer distance learning for students especially the parents. Most parents would want their kids to go to school and take classes because they think it's better for them. They probably think that they're are ways to cheat if they take classes online. Some parents would want their kids to interact with other students and not just be home all the time.

I agree on all the reasons why they student shouldn't take distance learning as an option but I think otherwise. It's a great option for students because there are many student that fail or drop out of school just because they didn't attend school. If students had the option to take classes online from home then it would give them a second chance to pass and graduate so they wouldn't give up. It even may help other students understand the curriculum more.

The generation now are giving up at such a young age just because they don't even want to attend their classes at school. This is why its a great idea for schools to offer distance learning so students won't just give up and drop out. Having the opportunity to take online classes from home with probably help those students the don't want to attend school. The students would take classes from their homes and learn the same information they would learn at school.

In conclusion, I think it would benefit many students if schools offered distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. It's a great way for students who don't like attending school most of the time. It would be a great advantage for students to have that offer of distance learning, it woud make a huge difference for the generation of students now a day.              ",4.0
"Do you think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I don't think the students would get benefits from being able to attend clasess from home. First, the students not have somebody like a teacher to tell what to do and no body give pressuare. For example: if the student don't want to do what the student have to do no body tells nothing. Second, the student who takes oline classes will not have any friends or somebody to talk. For example: Everybody want any friend or somebody who can we talk if you do stay at home you never meet someone and never know somebody. Third, the student maybe can get frustate to be lonely at home. For example: if the student take oline classes and watch videos conferencing maybe will be boring and the studend get stress in another part if the student take the classes at school he be with friends or somebody to talk. Next, if the student stay at home the student can do whatever the student want to do. For example: if the student want to play video games the student can do that and if the student want to sleep he can do that too because the student will not feel with any responsability also, if the student wants to go outside he can do that because the student will be at home and maybe their parents work all day. Finally, if you take the classes at home and never came to school you cannot live the experinces that we live at school. For example: if you take a classes at home you cannot participate in any activity that the school have like a any sport or party or any activity that one is so funny and you can enjoy the activities with you friend or teachers who always are there for us to lisen if you have any problem and the techer are like a secret box because you can tell whatever you want and they never tell to someone. That's why I think is nice to get classes at school and I think is not so good to take classes at home because you can get more fun at school and is a experince that you will never forget.

In another part if you did not want to get school because someboby bother you like if another student tell you a nickname that you di not like maybe can be a reason that you did not want came to school but you can took with you adviser or your's parents because every body have a opportunity to be at school and anybody can't tell you anything.

"One topic that is frequently debated is about the benefit people receive to take classes online. Some people think that if someone want to keep study they have to go a school to take that class or the classes that they need. They feel that some people do not deserved the chance to take classes from their home. In my opinion i think that taking classes online is a good opportunity for many people because people can work and study at the same time, those classes can be more cheap, and not everybody have the opportunity to attend a college or an university.

First taking classes online is the opportunity that everybody want, but not everybody have. The people that take classes online is getting many advantages. They can work at the same that they are taking classes, they can take the classes during the flight or if they are in another country visiting their family they can take the classes there. They can do a lot of things during taking classes online, and they always have free time to do whatever they want. But the most important you can help your family in home or and your country.

Second online classes can be more cheaper than attending a college everyday all day. All my aunts that graduate from high school are taking classes online and they are close to end taking classes. They said is more cheap and we can save money taking those classes than attending everyday to a college. They save money and now they are capable to pay and attend a college. I personally think that is a good option for me to keep study save money and got o a college.

Finally go to a university in United States is something that not everybody can do. Because you have to speak a perfect English, you have to have good grades, your GPA have to be great, and for people that does not born here and is not a legal and just have tree or 4 years studying is almost impossible. My sister born here she went to Generic_School she was in the ten best GPA and now is in Virginia Tech University one of the best universities and Virginia. I do not think i will go there i just have tree and half years here, i will take classes online during my parents and me save money to pay a college. I am planing to got to NOVA but i will take classes online first.

As you have read classes online have many advantages that we can get if we take it. We can save money, spend time with our family , visit many places and the possibility to go a college. Classes online is the way that you can get your goal, the way that you can feel comfortable taking it at home. But also is the way that you can work and get money. classes online was made for people like us, that are trying to study and be a professional in the future. ",3.0
"One day Generic_Namehad to go somewhere important with his family, but the problem was that he also had school to attend to. So he decided to do a video chat with his class, so he didnt he didn't have to miss anything from school. Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Doing oline stuff and video conferencing is a great way for students to stay on task with their work. I think that students would take the benificial of being able to attend to school from home because they have responsibilities and also a future ahead of them.

First reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they have responsibilities. What if you get sick and don't want to miss anything then you can just video chat with the class. Your familiy decide to take a trip somewhere on a school week what do you do. You take your school stuff with you and a laptop to talk with the class. You can't miss more than like 9 days of schoo if you do you automatically fail, and that's your biggest responsibility on not failing, so you can take the advantage of video chatting with your class. Those are the reasons why I say students should do a video confrence because they have responsibilities.

Second reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they might want to have a future ahead of them. When you are in your senior year that's when ou got to step up your game. What if you miss the bus or don't have a ride and you can't get to school then you obviously just video chat with your classes. If you don't understand with your school work you can do learning stuff online so you don't feel behind. Doing online stuff as well help students who don't know what they are doing and feeling left behind. Those are the reasons why students should do video confrences and online stuff because they want to have a future ahead of them.

Lastly, some people don't want to take the benificial of having video confrences or oline stuff to do school stuff at home. The reason why they don't want to do that is because when they are home they just want to have free time not to do school work at home. Also when they are sick they don't do anything because they think that they don't have that much work to miss. Well you see when you are home not doing anything then what are you getting done obviously nothing because they think that when they go back to school they won't miss that much work. That's why you should either do online stuff or a video confrence with your classes so you don't miss anything or be left behind.

"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more. Attending a school can get you ready in the real world then just attending classes from home.

Those who say attending classes from home say that because teacher cant teach the way they want. They have to follow the way the schools wants you to learn. For example, the teacher does not want to teach some of the stuff hes given but he has to because at the end of the day this is his job and he does not want to lose his job. When your attending classes from home you have more sleep and you wont be tired because it will be at your own time. And also you dont have to be in a class that the teacher dont really like to teach because over time some teachers lose that feeling that they loved.

However, people believe that attending schools is way better then just staying home. Some reasons you should attend school then stay home is that you will have more fun in a class room then just home all the time. For example, you will make friends and do stuff together the will make your time more joy able then just at home. you wake up and go to school you see your friends and you make jokes and help each other and it is limitless.

Another reason you should attend school then classes at home. Schools have field trips,sports,after school activities that you will probably love to do. Because you have the chance to try all of them at school. For example, there are filed trips to the art museum that have great at works like the monalisa. And filed trips to New York and other places that you will love to see. Sport teams are like family, you watch each others back and help improve you game together and thats something you cant get from home or video conferencing. Other reason why you should attend school with others is that someday you will find a bond with someone or a group that will last and you will be grateful for. For example, There were couples in high school that later on got married and there were these groups that became friends actually the became family.

In conclusion, Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more. Attending school is better for your kids in the long run. You can learn more in school then you could ever at home and you will make friend and maybe family.",3.0
"In my opinion the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a excellent idea for everybody. We have many benefit from to being able to attend classes from home for example, we have more time for sleep and have more energy for study, also the students has more dedication, the students has more concentration for study in home because, nobody distract to the student, the students have more time for make other things like work or others pastime

Many student don't like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I don't think so because we have help of all teachers. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they don't pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life.

Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you.

For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. Maybe

This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable. Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience.

In my conclusion I support and for me is a good idea the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because is a new experience and i like it the idea and is more comfortable stay in home is more peace, more concentration, is more time for study and more important is learned more things, new thing for the future because the place is not important you can study in others places but the important is study more and more. Study is more important, the place is not important beacuse when the person want to be someone like a professional in the future they need study much.",3.0
"Students wouldn't benefit from attending to classes at home. Schools offer different options that distance learning does not. It's a good opportunity to attend regular classes. Everyone can learn in different ways but a better option it's by attending normal classes. People have the option to choose whith what they feel comfortable. Attending to regular classes gives the opportunity to pick their own classes. We can have many benefits by this. If students attend to regular schools they have the opportunity to meet new people, to participate at clubs and they have the chance to talk and get help from teachers.

Students who attend normal schools have the opportunity to meet new people. Not everyone likes to be anti-social and to be alone without not knowing others. Sometimes is great to have a person that we can tell everything. By going to school, we have the chance to talk to a thousand of people and to make new friends. Once Generic_Name got the options to pick home school or to attend to normal classes. She chose to do classes at home. She was happy for the idea that she has not to wake up early. For the first couple of weeks everything was fine. She was getting use to it. One day she realized that she has no friends; she feels alone. Generic_Name when to talk to her mom about the way she was feeling. Her mom told her that if she weren't pick to stay at home and doing distance learning; she weren't to feel that way. Generic_Name thought about what her mom told her and she decide that the best option was attend to normal classes at school. If we attend to regular classes, we are not going to feel alone and we can make new friends.

Schools provides the chance to participate at clubs. While distance learning don't have activities or clubs for students to do. Public schools have different kind of activities or clubs that they can enjoy. Activities and clubs are a good way to help and to prepare students for the future. They have the option to enjoy a team from their preference. For example, a person who like football. They might like to form part of the football team and that's what normal schools provides. If this person form part of a football team; he can get scholarships to participate in big leagues. From clubs students can get an idea of what career they want to get in the future, to discover new things, and to get experience from this different activities.

Other might argue that distance learning gives students time for their jobs, they can avoid being getting in trouble and they can take care of their youngest siblings while they are at home. However, people by attending to classes have the chance to get help from teachers. It's a reality that not everyone is capable to understand easily. Sometimes we need a push or help from others who knows about the things we don't. The awesome thing about normal schools is that teachers stay a little longer after school to help with hard work. To pay attention during classes can be hard because of other classmates are making noise or it's really hard to understand. Teachers talk about our grades and gives us advices to improve them. Talking to teachers helps to understand because they give us a deeply explanation.

At school people have the chance to make new friends, to have the oppoortunity to try new activities and to improve academically with the help of teachers. Some people can be in disagreement with public schools, but they have on mind that sometimes it can be a better option. School it's a good way to get out of home for at least some hours. Not everyone likes to being at home for the whole day. At school we can have fun with our friends, lunch time is unique and that is something the distance learning don't offer. Activities after school are a good way to keep people out of trouble. To help them to choose a good path. School have a variety of ways to have fun, not just by playing, also by learning. ",3.5
"I know taking online or watching video conferencing class can be relaxing sometime, and sometimes student even pray for school to be close. but that does not mean student should take online classes or watch video conferencing , It not a good idea for student to be take online classes and I am not in favor of the idea for student to take online or watch video conferencing because they can find the online teaching to be boring and it will be very hard for student to understand the teaching of the video.

Although some people might think that taking online or video conferencing class can be helpful because student can get a lot of sleep before starting the class and the student will be the one to choose the time he or she wish to take the class or watch the video conferencing.

firstly why I don't agree with the idea of taking home school or watch video conferencing is because student find home school to be boring and they can't focus in the teaching of the video conferencing. like for example if the person who is teaching in the video speaks softly it will make that student feel sleeping and by the time he or she get up the video might be finish at the end of the day the student don't gained anything from the online teaching, and other student will turn on the video and still be charting with their friends on the phone while the video is playing, he or she will not focus on the video that is teaching.

secondly why I said home schooling or video conferencing can't be beneficial for student is because student will find it very hard to understand the teaching of the video conferencing or the home schooling. like if the video is playing but the student don't understand the teaching of the video he or she can't get the chance to ask question about what they don't understand .And some of this video teaching sometime is really confusing the student that why other student prefer to set in class while teaching so that if he or she don't understand they can ask question about the topic. other student have their young ones at home while he or she want to listen to the teaching their young ones will be make noise so they can't get what the video is teaching about and that will make them not to understand the teaching.

I am not in favor of the idea of student taking online classes because they will find it very boring which they can't focus on the teaching and it will very hard for them to understand the teaching of the video.

for this way I find it very difficult for student to gained any learning from taking the online or the video conferencing class.       ",3.0
"I agree that students would benefit better on taking online classes and video conferencing at home. Most of the students prefer online classes because they can't get transportation from home to class. Video conferencing and online classes would benfit students in a way that their will be less distraction and work in your own level. Society now in days has many bullies in school that it comes to the point that studuents don't want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self.

For example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school but they can't because they have no way to get to school. Online classes and Video conferencing is way were students can get education and graduate without leaving their house. My cousin got education and he graduated and he only took online classes and it helped him a lot due to not having tansportation to school.

There are many kids out in the world thet get bullied in school and they want a education but they can't due to bullys. Classes at home can benefit kids getting bullied in many ways for example,

you won't have to worry about getting bullied at home if you take classes at home, you will get less distraction, and you will work in your own level taking classes at home.

Therefore, This is why I agree that students can benefit better taking classes at home in many ways. Online classes and video conferencing may benfit some people but due to experience with family members and friends

a lot of students needs help with one person to support them with their work. Some students are not smart enough to work by their-self. If students take classes at home they might have some issues.

For example from my point of view I think students should come to school. Because is more helpful for them they get help from their teachers. They communicate with others share their thoughts. If their having problems with their assignment they can ask for help.

however some students are not agree to come to school because they might not like to wake up early every morning or deal with others. Some students have bad attitudes and they dont like been with others or forced to talk. But it is more important to come to school because it benefits you gain more experience.",3.0
"Being able to take online classes from home, is something that i would like for all schools to offer. Graduating high school is a need in this time and generation, for the reason being that most jobs ask for at least if you graduated high school. There is lots kids in school and not all have the time to go to school, some kids have to help there parents work for there not financially stable. I myself have gone through that where had gone to an alternative school so i could have more time to work in the day and come home to do some of my courses. Many people say education is the number one thing you should worried about and thats right, though some kids can't cause they have to help there family to provide in relation to paying some bills, put food on the table or picking up there siblings. providing school to be done at home will help the kids that have to go through all of this.

high school can be hard at times work is stressful some kids hate to having to get up early is hard for them so they miss out in some of class time. You keep missing some of class every day it can turn into hour's of class time that you missed, also can effect in the way you are learning having more time in your day to work can help you for there you are learning at your own paste, not the teachers. Some students that learn slow. takes time for them to learn one thing and by then the teacher is on the next unit there learning about. everyone has there own way that they learn better students that are fast learners wish that they can learn everything faster to get the class over with to go on to the next. those students can get classes online so they could do them at home to get the most credits they want this would also help them graduate faster.

Very few kids know what they want to work as for there career. Doing online classes can help these students graduate earlier to go the school they want to go to, or there career they want to lean on. This can help these students out in many ways. Going into a career path the earliest you can is a great thing you can get more time to learn and get good at to what you want to be doing like working become a master tech the younger you are the more experience you could have when you get older. The more chances you can get to become the best master tech at your location. Many students in high school learn in there own way also are smart in there own way graduating early can help students to become what they want to be the most.                           ",3.0
"We will not be benefice of taking classes online and the reasons can be for slow internet, get distracted and not having time.

There is a bounch of students that have problems with slow internet, some times the internet doesn't

load the wed pages and with slow internet we can not due our online classes. One time i was with my friend in his home and he was taking his class online like every day and then the internet when down and he did not finish his class online and the internet didn't work until the next day.

Most of the time we get distracted at home, for reasons that are not even important at all like we wan to eat, our parents need help and they call us and we need to use the restroom every time and those reasons can be a big issue for people who take classes online.When i was in LOCATION_NAME i took some classes online, it was my first class and my uncle did not know what i was doing classes online and he call me more then 3 times and because i was using my headphones and i did not ear when he call me the 3 times he get mad, he disconnect the computer and the computer shot down, i did not finish the class beacuse of my auncle and the teacher tell me that i was so disrespectfull to her and she didn't wan to give me classes again.

One of the most common problem is the student don't have time for example we have jobs and we don't have time for classes online. Some of the students are in club or they go to church, they also take care of there little brothers, with these reasons is why taking classes at home is not a really good idea.

Do you really thing that taking classes online can benefit student? Issues can occur, when we are doing the classes online from problems of slow WI-FI and also problems or differences with family that may affect us in our concetration with the classes, that's why i don't agree of having classes online.

"My friend is home schooled because she use to get bullied a lot so she wanted to drop out, she could'nt deal with it anymore. Her counselor gave her a better option taking online classes because she had very good grades and she wanted her to graduate and have a good future. In some schools they offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think getting home schooled is a good benefit for students who have situations at school, for student drop outs, and it's easier and quicker.

The primary reason on why it's a good benefit, it's that it helps you if you have bad situations at school such as you always get into fights with other students, you are getting harassed or bullied, you have problems with your teachers, or you think you're wasting your time and you could be working and getting money. Having online classes can help you stay out of trouble or helps you stop what ever you are dealing with. Not only it stops the situation but can help you improve and graduating with no problem. If you are having problems talk to your counselor and ask for a possibility for online classes or your parents if you can get home schooled.

Secondly, it benefits the students who are dropping out of school. Most of the students who are dropping out are for financial reasons like, they want to help there family so, they drop out and start working or some teens get pregnant at a young age and there parents most likely they dont support them or help them in anything that they need so, it causes them to drop out. It helps them further there knowledge and can possibly get a better job. It makes them feel happy knowing they can finish school because they know they already making a decision by dropping out but they can still graduate by taking online classes. I remember when i was at student counseling aide and one day a student came to ask me where should he leave his laptop because he was planning to drop out, he looked upset. Generic_Name ask him why? he answered ""i wanna help my family out they dont have any money right now"" she gave him an option for online classes he didnt know it was possible to do that and It made him happy.

Finally, getting home schooled is easier and quicker. You can take your classes when ever you are free. If you need to take a break, you can and continue when ever you are ready. it's non-stressful comparing to regular school. Its proven that getting home schooled its less stressful than regular school. Generic_Name is a science teacher at SCHOOL_NAME he said ""88% students are stressed about school because of homework and not having to finish assignments on time"". He also said ""only 5% are stressed when they are home schooled"". In conclusion, it's less stressful and help you feel non-pressured while you are taking your online classes. It also, gives you free time and gives you advantage to do what ever you like. You get to be home and relax wake up when ever you like to, do your classes take brakes if you would like to, too me it sounds amazing!

Some people might say that getting home schooled is bad because if you have any questions you dont have a teacher to ask or a physical teacher to help you understand the topic you are learning about but it's a one on one class. There's no students just you and your instructor, it helps you focus which i personally think it will help you more comparing sitting in a class room with your friends not paying attention, playing around or not getting work done. I think it's a good benefit having online classes because it helps with people who have bad situations at school, people who are planning to drop out and its a fast and easier way to get your classes done.",4.0
"Many will say that distance learning is a really good option for students. Several students will benefit from distance learning by having better attendance, less problems , and it will also help students with certain disabilities or health problems . On the other hand , some will disagree by saying that if students dont attend actual school they will become lazy and irresponsible. Distance learning will benefit many student and also school.

Distance learning will benefit students in many ways such as better attendance . If students are allowed to attend school while at home it will give them less chances of not attending. Something that students hate most is waking up in the morning to get ready for school. Having to wake up so early in the morning just to attend school for about eight hours will cause a student to become lazy and tired.

Unfortunately some student are born or are diagnosed a certain disability to where they cant attend school . However those students with disabilities have a right to have an education. Distance learning will really benefit those students by allowing them to attend school from home. There are many reasons why students benefit from distance learning but being able to help a child with a disability on their education is the most important reason.

If students dont attend their actual school there will be less problems. Some students are treated really bad in school , many are bullied , and also many like to be drama queens . However if students attend school at home it will benefit a child because they wont have to see other students and there will be less drama and more education. Schools will stop having so many bullying problems.

On the other hand many will disagree and say that if students stay at home and pursue their education there they will become irresponsible and lazy. Students should be allowed to attend school how they want to . If a students becomes lazy because of distance learning the problem is within the student. Many will agree that it will make a student less lazy and more responsible. ",4.0
"Students have to attend school to learn more efficiently, but long distance learning is not good because you have to take your own notes online ,however, if you were to attend school on regular time, you would not have to worry about taking your own notes. Although, online is still a option because you just need a computer or a laptop to take online classes, and not having to worry about missing the class when the teacher took notes that day. All you have to do for online school or video conferencing is get online and do all your classes, and not worry about getting to school. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school.

Going to school than taking online classes or video conference is way better because you go to school and actually pay attention and not get distracted of what is around you in school ,however, taking online classes can get you easily distracted when you're at home or a public place trying to do you work and you hear people talking and having conversations all around you. While you're in school you can peacefully finish all your work in class and ask for a question, or even help from the teacher, but if you're taking online classes your only source is most likely going to be a online source, or the guides they give you online which might not be always correct. The information online could be outdated. while the information at school is planned out and ready to be given out by the teacher or staff at school. Even though, everyone would prefer online classes over actually going to school, people should consider going to school for a backup just in case the people taking online classes don't like how it is done. Going to school and learning just for being in class helps you in a lot of ways such as visually, speaking, and self control, however, if you're at home taking online classes it will only help on your visual learning.

Taking online classes can probably be difficult sometimes, because people can forget to take the class the day you need to log in ,however, going to school and knowing which days to go to school is very helpful because you can learn without any problems happening. Although taking classes online and not having to go anywhere and stay where you are is good, you're putting your grades at risk, the computer can malfunction or even be corrupted with a virus on it, and it can slow down your computer or even shut it off every time you need to do your work. This is why going to school is more efficient. The people that go to school have no worries just bring all the materials they need for class and work and pay attention. Also students can have more time to work and can be actively speaking with our teachers too, for questinos and answers to help students. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school.",3.5
"Some students take online classes they think is good to take more classes than in classroom.

However, when they need to turn the work and they are stuck in problem they can not find teacher to help them, or the device has broken, so students they can not turn the work.

Although some people think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it is actually true that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there are no teacher for help them and some students they do not have internet at home.

When the students find a problem they will need teacher for help them to turn the work before the deadline.

However, if there are no teacher for helps them, then students will can not turn the work on time and students will get bad grade.

As result, one student is takes class online, in one day he find problem that he can not understand it and there are no teacher for help him, then he get bad grade because he can not understand the problem to turn the work on time.

So, if the students take the classes in classroom they will turn the work on time because there are teacher in classroom.

Therefore, students need teacher for solve the problem that the students was stuck on it to turn the work.

Some student they do not have internet at home or they do not have good internet to do the work.

However. some students when they do the work they can not submit it before time end because they do not have good internet.

As result, one student he live in area that they do not have good internet, so when he want to submit the work the network does not working and then he get bad score because he did not submit the work.

So, if the students take the classes in classroom they do not need internet to submit the work.

Therefore, students they do not need internet to submit the work in classroom.

To conclude, students will benefit from taking the classes in classroom to get good grade, understand the lesson and learn form lessons to help them in life time.

Therefore, classroom was benefit more than take the classes online because students will find teacher to help them and they do not need internet to turn the work. ",3.0
"The Downside of Online Classes

A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home.

To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. The distraction is not because we don't want to do the work, but it's our minds. Everyone's minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work.

Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances,

football games, and pep rallies. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldn't go to a public school and decided to take online school instead.

Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldn't want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I don't know what else to do to not be bored at home. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons.

Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy.",4.5

Their are some schools that offer to attend online classes or video conferencing what if they don't have a computer at home for to be able to use it for the online class. Some parents will not agree I think because they will be working and they don't know with who they can leave their kids with. Video Conferencing could work for students instead of online classes because that way the person that will come to teach you can explain more better from the assignments that your suppose to do. Some students just prefer someone to teach them for they can help with what they are doing. Students will benefit from being abkle to attend classes from home will some students they would rather take classes home then school because in school they think it's more harder for them for the reason of being with alot of stusdents. They like to work alone quite and with someone who can have patients and work slowly and have time. Same thing with there schedule when you have classes at home you can choose the time and day that you want to do the class.             ,3.0
"Online courses and receiving your education at home can be beneficial in many ways due to the fact that you're technically not in ""school"" for seven hours a day learning. For this very reason, being home schooled and having online courses gives you the chance to have more time to do your work, reevaluate, and overall to take as long as you may need, and whats important is feeling comfortable and moving at your own pace.

Although, some may take this as an advantage or opportunity to try and fit in extracurricular activities and or to try and learn new things because maybe they want to pursue something different that needs more time of something and less time of a seven hour education course that restricts them of doing so because school takes up almost of half of the time in their every day life.

Online classes can often help people but make it harder for other people to learn, sometimes you'll need a buddy to help out or you'll need a teacher to ask questions to learn but people may take online courses because they feel that they can work better alone rather than to be working with others and thats where they could be in the wrong.

You're not always going to know everything, you have to give yourself the chance to open up and have the opportunity so that you could expand your knowledge of education, there's a point in time where you've got to say ask a classmate or teacher for help, and Im not speaking on the behalf of everyone but thats how people are, they think they can learn everything there is to know about something but you've got to take a step back and know when to say hey and say these five simple words and that is, ""may I get help please"".

Therefore I do Indeed agree that taking online classes is a great way to benefit off of beacause people may feel that they can work on their own and move at their own pace and overall just have an amazing experience at the end of the day.       ",4.0
"Students would benefit attending school from home in many ways.... students would be able to work in a quiet environment with no distractions from other students. Another reason why it would be better would be because, some students work in their own speed and won't be worried about how fast others finish. Sometimes students are more focused on who finishes first and sometimes think it's a race. students would also have the chance of working on their own time when they can,like that students could proprobly finish their work faster. Online school could also be better for students sleep schedule, like that students could be more rested and would be able to focus on their work.

Better sleeping schedule would help kids focus more on their work and would be able to stay up, whens students dont sleep well the tend for fall asleep in class. Falling asleep in class effects on class grades because student pay less attention. Having to wake up early and get ready on time is hard work,making it on time to school is a big task. Just having online classes from home would be better for everyone in general, would honestly make students life much more easier.

"To Begin with, many student have many excuses to not attend school. Of curse, that we can change this to not be happen anymore. Student may not complete the school if they lose the year.

What would happen if student get affected for all student that not attend school? For example, like I seen in me that I have a lot of appointment that is affecting me and my grade. We can not let this happen we need to do many thing in order to not let our child lose. In addition,

principal should offer distance learning for student that the way could not affect them because student might have a natural disaster in their neighborhood, student might be sick in such manner that could not attend school, that might affect their grade and they might repeat the year.

First reason, student might be absent for a reason like to be sick in such manner that could not attend school. All included student that is special that they go for a week or more in the hospital. Moreover, student sometime the doctor let a lot of appointment for them to check up or appointment with the dentist. Also, student who have allergies when the weather change they got affect in that they may not come to school. In high school, student sometime they get pregnant and the doctor let them many appointment including when they delivery they lose many school days and that affect many student lose the year or they may get affect their grade. Because we don't know in the future what will happen to some of our student that many of them don't find any solution of their problem. In fact, we don't know what it will happen if we don't give an opportunity to our students. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem.

Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days. Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in there's no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient.

To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video. Finally, we should give the student an opportunity they will enjoy it and they will not throw it away. ",3.0
"This generation is influenced by technology and they are used to it. They would be more comfortable with it as they are used to it . It's beneficial for students to do distant learning more than to go to school and do it.

Distant learning is already being used through online and video conferencing, This days colleges and universities allows students to choose online courses of their own choices . Students are used to online stuff like, web browsing, gaming, and etc. which gives them an extra advantage already. They would be more successful using online browsing. Video conferencing is another way of distant learning; this would let the teachers talk to students in case they need help. People has been using video conferencing to even take tests at home.

Distant learning would also help them have success in education socially. If students are to stay at home to learn, they would feel more comfortable around somewhere they been for a long time. They could ask people, family members who they are comfortable with, for help if they wanted to. They would be more fit and ready than going to school considering that you have to wake up early in the morning, get ready and walk to school. They wouldn't have to do any of this, and have enough sleep to have a fresh mind to work with.

It is beneficial for students to use distant learning to attend classes such as, video conferencing and online browsing. I personally think that its better for me and lots of other students to use distant learning as it can help in a social and educational way.                          ",3.5
"Many students and teachers think that taking online classes are bad for the students and the school. The reason is that the students might not take any notes on what the teacher is saying. The other reason is that students will often get distracted from the lecture the teacher is giving to them. Students cannot be benefited of taking online classes because students might not take notes and that the students might not pay attention to the teacher.

Students might not take notes while being on a class that is online. For example, at school, students take notes because they are being watched by the teacher, so why would they do it if they are not being watched by the teacher; the students would not care about the notes. If the teacher is on the screen, but cannot see if the student is taking notes; most likely there are not because the students won't worry that the teacher could check them. Students should take notes when they get information about a topic, so that topic could stay in the mind of the student if they write it and they also try understand the topic from the notes. Teacher's won't even know there students are taking notes because it's online they cannot see them. also the students might not be paying attention.

The students might not pay any attention to the lecture the teacher is giving to them. For example, when a student looks around the classroom, but not at the teacher, they will miss valuable information that is needed, so it's like the same when it comes to online classes; information will be missed by the students. Missing information when distracted is terrible because students might miss out on what is going on in the class, might miss on something on they have to do, and miss on how to do there work. Students should pay attention; no one likes to miss any key information; therefore, students need to look at the teacher to get more information as needed to do an assignment. When students don't take notes, they will not only miss out on some key information, but might panic on how to do a problem on the assignment they were given.

The students cannot benefit from taking online classes because the students might not write valuable information in there notes and they might not pay attention to lecture that teacher is giving to them. The students won't take any notes because no one is watching them take the notes as the teacher goes on lecturing. The students could miss valuable information because they are not paying attention to the teacher, and the students might miss on how to do something in a assignment. From not taking notes to note paying attention is the reason why there cannot be students taking online classes because teachers might not know what the students are doing and students might not even care about all of this.",3.5
"Boom!One day PROPER_NAME mom decided that she wanted him to join the distance learning classes.Where they could have online or video conferences with there school teachers.PROPER_NAME would sit around all day on his phone playing videos games instead of doing his online or video conferences.PROPER_NAME is like many others who thinks school is not all that important.I believe that schools should not offer distance learning to students.Therefore,students would not benefit from attending classes at home because students would have more free-time, students would be discourage that school is not important,Also they would skip classes to meet up with friends.

First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall

for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c

Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream and horse back riding. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesn't feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley.

Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for biology and start staying home she get discourage that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay for her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible.",3.0
"In this paragraph I will write about how students can take classes from their homes and if they are going to do good in the works that the teachers give to the students on online, talk to the cousolers or tho his admistrator, the students will have some benefit, Students will have benefits with the grades.

If the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Second, the students have to take test before they do the classes online because the teachers or another people from the school can see if he really is going to do the work at home and be prepaed for all the work that the teacher will give to him/students. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online.

The students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before. Second, They will have benefit because they are not going to school and he can go out during the day and also do the work when they're out. Finally, Students also will have benefit because they can do the work whenever they want bacuse if they have the classes online at the computers is more easier for example, if they only have to take notes they only can see another attachment of the same thing and if they have a test they will see the notes or another paper about the test.

Students will have benefits with the grades. Firts, the students will have good grades because they will have a lot of time do the work that is assigment for the next day or the same day and they will be concentrate because they are going to be alone at home. Second, The students will have a lot of benefit in that because they can see some work abouth the assigment and have a 100 points in the assigment or if they have a project that the students who are in the school they only will have a hour to do it because the others teacher will give a lot of homework to them but the student whp is taking classes online he will have a lot of work too bute he will have all the day to do it or the next day.

In conclusion they can't take classes online because they will have a lot of benefits that the students who is going to school and they can sleep a lot and the regular student has to wake up early and they can't have benefit with grades or other benefits,

In my opinoin students should not to take classes online because that is going to be more easy than the stduent who take classes at school becuase the students who is in the school they are not going to have he same benefits as the students who take classes online.",3.0
"I think that it a good that some schools offer distance learning for the students because some of them can't go to the regular schools and some of them are not able to finished one school and the distance learning offer a good idea for them. and is a very good experience. If can be a good apportunity for does who can't fiinish the school for example

Some of the students have kids and have to take care of them.

Another reason is that the students does not have the support of their family and they have to work for them self.

Also the family of the students can not affords the students education.

The person who received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and that person is trying to finished now for get a better job.

I think it good that some of schools offer distance learning. First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of the kids. Next The students does not have their family support and they have to support them self and work. Also the families of the students can not affords the student education. And finally the person or students that received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and is tying to finish now to get a better job. because with a better job they can support the baby they have and the things they want to finish up.

First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of them. Also the students a girl or boy get a pregnancy when they go to school and they had to leak of school for the baby. Also the parents make them to work because they have to support a baby. And some moms have to leak school because the other parent of the kid does not take care of the baby when she was pregnant. Study in the distance learning program they want work in the day and in the night they cant received classes.

Next another good reason is that the students does not have the support of their families and have to work for them self. Some of the kids are immigrants and they doesn't have their parents in this country. And also the student have to work and maintain by them self. The students have to work and go to school .But sometime get difficult for them and the time it not always log as they want to do many things at the day. And it better to have a option .Because with that option that can still working and receiving a good education.

Also another reason is that the families of the students can not affords the students education. And they try to do another thing for them like the parent can buy a computer. And with that the student can received the classes online or in the distance learning. But some of them use their phone to received their classes. Also some of them like to study but their parents cant not affords the school and they try to do anything to get a good education and a better future. Because that is going to help them to be able to have a family. And with that they prepare for the future.

The last reason that why is a good idea to get the distance learning is because some of the people that is getting the classes online are oldest people the they did not finish the school and now they're trying to finish the school .Because they want a better job and a better future for their family and their kids. Some of them did not finish the school and they now want to finished. They just want a opportunity to study and the distance learning give that opportunity to the old people that want to overcome. And that is a great help for the people that just want a better life a great future for them and their families. With that the people who is trying to finished the school can be prepare to have better opportunities of work. And also finished the school he or she can get a better job and be able to be with their kids. And don't leave their kids with another person many time. And spend more time with them.

In conclusion the distance learning education is a very good idea in my opinion. because the people that can not go to school because they have kids or the teenager that have a pregnancy when they were on the school. That give opportunity for the people with low income. The people that can afford their school. And also the people that does not have their family in this country. The people who work and study and does not have the time to go to a regular school. Classes in online is good for does that need to finish the school. For does that when they were in the school have some problems. Also is a good benefit for those that there time is not long as they want. The people of the distance learning have good opportunity for their future. And can be productive for the people who does not have a work because they did not finish the school. because have an education is important for this country and for all the people that want a good life and better opportunities of work. Finally the distance education is a good ideas because help people with the things they want and that they need too.    ",3.0
"Dear Dr. Generic_Name,

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my letter, hope you and your staff are doing well. My name is Generic_Name and I'm currently a Junior at Generic_School. I believe that some students should benefit from taking online classes because we won't have to worry about turning in papers late, or having to hearing teachers to put our phones and headphones away, and also I won't worry about owing school lunch money. Online classes is a should and it can also be a shouldn't, and i will explain why its a should.

In school we all panic when we hear a due date, especially when its up close. Students work better at their pace than rather to wait on the teacher, teachers go slow just for the other students get to know what's going on. When taking tests, or quizzes, we seemed to get rush because we only have that class for and hour and some change. In some cases if we don't finish on time they, will ask us to stay after school. Some of our parents work late nights and won't be able to get a ride back home. Also in school we all get distracted so easily, like from fights that happen in school, drama, and class clowns that are not really doing their work. And kids need to concentrate in their work instead of lacking off.

At Generic_School, phones and headphones are a huge problem. Some of us like to listen to music and work better with it, but however, some teachers don't always allow it in the classroom. Classes at home can be such a big change in a good way, we won't get in trouble if we get found using our phones or even listening to music. A lot of teachers find this disturbing and run to writing us up, but they won't understand how much faster your brain functions when listening to music, it gets you more concentrated into your own work.

Our parents work and the school thinks that they make lots of money, due to that cause the school charges us for the food we eat. In some cases we get milk that's been expired, and they dont even notice it. Classes that we can take at home could benefit us here, we have better food at home and wont worry about if the food that we get at school is expired or not. Online classes can be much cheaper than to actually go to school. At home, we can eat breakfast and lunch and not think about that eating breakfast or too early or if eating lunch is too late.

Thank you once again for reading my thoughts, I strongly agree that our students should benefit from taking online classes while being at home.

Sincerely,

Generic_Name",3.0
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? There is a debate if students would benefit or not from online classes? Some people believe that students would do better if their classes are at home. I believe that you can learn more if you are in a regular class than just being at home because students can learn from other cultures or more things about life with other friends, if students do not interact with others in a future they are going to be afraid to do it, and finally if you are in a regular school you can do more activities and share with your friends.

First, when you are in a school of the united states you learn a lot from other cultures. Therefore besides than world geography, you learn from your friends countries and how is to live there. Also, when you have friends at school you share your problems and most of the time you learn more things about life with them and how you can be a better person.

Second, sometimes there can be shy people at school because they do not know how to interact with others or how to start a conversation. When you do activities in groups sometimes you make new friends and talk to others became easily than before. However, if students do not learn how to talk to others in public places they are going to be afraid in a future; imagine if they need to make a presentation at work, they are not going to be able to do it because they will be afraid to talk in front of all the co-workers. Learn how to interact with others is important for your future.

Third, it is important to get involve in activities at school; activities help you with your curriculum when you apply to college. Also, if you are in any activity you can share more with your friends. However, when you get involved with activities at school helps you to clear your mind when you have to many homework or when you are stress out about your classes. Therefore, some of the activities give a lot of skills in the thing that you would like to do in your future.

In conclusion, if students do not interact with others or neither have a friend to talk with, and they do not have activities to get involved with other people; students are not going to be successful if they try in a future to interact with a large group of people. Therefore, it is very important to learn from others and interact at your school. That is why I believe that everybody should take classes on a regular school, to learn how to get involved with others and be able to express your self.   ",3.5
"Some student can take classes at home because they could find a subject of course that like. Learning websites can help them get better at what they do. It could benefit because they it would seem easier to go on different classes or to take a video to study a subject. For example, taking classes online would give you a head start. Many other schools have students at home take taking these course and have them apply for it. It is like a benefit for them to take some opportunity to get taught about something they have learn or to have a different way of learning it.

I will think they would able to do this if they are interested. For example, Home-schooling could that much money. There could be some reasons for them.

1. They want to try out some different learning strategies.

2. They can apply online.

3. They can try taking some subjects that they like.

In conclusion, it could be able to work for the home-schoolers to also have an education because they did not go to public but have it at home.",2.5
"No, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. There is a lot of action students have to take from being home school.

For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. You have to be responsible and be aware of your work. I'm not saying all students can't attend online classes at home, but most cannot.

Going to school helps you learn and understand things better. if you dont get something, you can ask for help and the teacher can explain the problem to you. You also have a person teaching you instead of you reading things by yourself and trying to understand. Being in class accurate and up can keep you from falling asleep instead of sitting around at home eating and sleeping all day. In addition of other students because i can't speak for everybody, some students can handle that and learn way better on their own than having somebody teach them.

School groups is also another reason how student learn faster and better. Working in groups help you learn more from other students. Other students may know more than you or you might know more than them, which is a good thing. Everybody has their own ideas and opinions. You can't forget some students are antisocial and like to work alone. If you are one of them people, than working alone and at home is best for you because you have nobody around to bother you.

Another reason being home schooled isn't a good idea because you have to be responsible. Doing your work, making sure you up, and making sure you finishing it on time. You have to make sure you get up on time, not staying asleep to long, or staying on your phone. Being at school you have to get what you need done, at home is like you know what you need done but you can do it later. Which makes you lazy, staying at home eating,sleeping,and playing on your phone makes you lazy. Its gonna make you forget that you have school to do. On the other hand some students are responsible. They know what have to get done and they get it done with or without any one telling them what to do or reminding them.

School is learning place where you come and get your knowledge from. Every parent should put their child in some learning program where they get taught not taught on their own. School is the most popular place in the world. Getting a education and great job is good reasons why you should come to school. Great job equals great money. Good education equals a high advance in getting in wonderful colleges. With out school you life won't be to bad but you know you can live a way better live with school.              ",3.5
"Some schools are considering the idea to offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home. Many students can benefit by considering this new idea for students to take classes from home by the way of online or videos. Although, many other students would not be agree with this idea.

In my opinion, I am not agree with the idea for students to attend classes from home. First, if the students are in their houses they would have more distraction, for example; they can get distracted by the food, many time food is a big distraction for students to concentrate in classes. They can also get distract because of the television, they can see something interesting in the TV and they would quickly get distracted. Also one of the biggest distraction for everyone is the cellphone. If a student is taking classes at home; no one would be responsible to tell him/she not to use their cellphones. Second, they would not take it seriously. They would feel free because they are in their houses. Sometimes they might take the classes; and sometimes they would not take them because no one would be telling them to do it. They would feel allow to do whatever they want because they would not have the rules like in a classroom. If the student is in a classroom; he/she receive more information, more examples, more attention, and more help. Every teacher has rules in their classrooms; rules that help students to be successful. And third

They would not be able to learn as much as they would in a classroom. They would not be able to ask questions and get the answer they would need. They would not receive as much attention as they need.

However, many students support the idea for students to attend classes from home. It can be considered a good idea for many students; because they would not be traveling from one place to another; it would safe them time. Also many times when there is a bad weather outside; many schools cancel classes; because they can't travel. And by considering this idea for students for students to attend classes from home would help them; because even if is raining or snowing, they will not cancel their classes. Therefore, many students agree with this idea because is not only going to safe them time; it would also help many students. Many students do not have transport. Sometime they have to walk or even pay so that they can go to school and attend to class. using the online program would give them a big support.

In conclusion, considering the idea for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video can be a good or a bad idea for many students. I do not support this idea. Students should not attend to classes online or video. Students can get distracted easily by anything or anyone in their house. Many time studying at home give students many issues; there can be many people at home and too much noise that the student would not be able to concentrated and will get distracted. It can also happen that watching a video and that there's no one there to explain it; can make the students tire and he/she can fall sleep. Also, students will not take it seriously because there's not a teacher telling them and explaining them what to do. They would not receive as much education, information, and attention as they need. My position on this issue is to maintain the students attending to school. The students will learn more if they receive classes in school. Attend classes in a classroom with a teacher will provide students more support and it would help them in many ways to be successful in the future.      ",3.5
yes becuase students would have more time to there work and is give more time the techer plan out the lesson but thye got give a time limeit to finsh the work cuz then students can get done the work and it would be hlepful to some students cuz some learn better by them self and they wouldnt feel rushed by the teacher to finsh the work before class ends but some other students learn better when ther is a teacher right there teaching face to face some students learn diifernt then others and there would be problems with students like getting trouble and it will teach students responepillity and it would show if they are willing t the work or if they care or dont care cuz now a days students dont really care about school they just come cuz they have to cuz if they didnt need to come they wouldnt come they just think that school a waste of time for them but they dont know how much they need school and how much school os gooing help them in the futer but it will give students more time to sit dont and work maybe they like it more then coming to school ,2.5
"I believe this would benefit students around the world, students would be able to attend classes from any school no matter where students live, this would help students who live far way from school and can't get a ride to school. Attending classes online from home would make it more comfortable for students.

Distance learning is good thing for students that want to study in school around the world or get the best education, students can be at home taking some classes that their country does not offer. Let's say a student lives in France and the student takes classes from United States, that's a good benefit, because you are learning education from another country in a different way that your country teaches you. This will be good for students who live in different country temporarily and are coming back to their countries.

The schools that offer distance learning are making life easier for some students who can't get education of they have to walk for hours to go to school. I remember watching a video about girl's life where she explains how far she has to walk though the mountains for 4 hours just to get to school. There are students who can't get education, because of the places they live, like places that are cold or far way from the city. This a good benefit in the United States since there's is a virus called corona virus in some states people are already effect with it, schools are closing cause of that students will be talking classes at home.

In school some students feel uncomfortable of working with their teachers or classmates, that makes students to stop working or lose interest on their work, but when they are home school students feel more comfortable, because they are at their house with their family, they feel more safe at their house and they can trust their family. In schools one of the main reasons why students feel uncomfortable of going to class is because some students get bully by their classmates, others get peer pressure to try to do things they don't like or be something they are not, making students not to be themselves. There was this famous video of a kid who was crying and told his mom that he wanted a knife to kill himself, he was just 7 years old, the reason why he wanted to kill himself is because many people at his school make fun him for being small, the students at his school were bullying him so much that he had to be home school and get therapist to help him get better and be comfortable.

At the end being able to attend classes at home depends if the students like it not everyone would think this is a good benefit for students others would think that is bad for students to take classes at home, because students will not get the chance to be social with other, this will make students not be able to work or talk with others outside in person, because they spent so much time at their houses taking classes by themselves. I have friend who used to be home school, now he goes to a high school and because he was home school, he doesn't talk that much in school, he doesn't have that many friends, it takes a while to get to know him. Taking classes from home is only good benefit if you want to take classes from another school, can't go to school because of where you live or it takes too long to walk to school, and if you don't feel comfortable in school, those are the main reasons students would taking classes from home. ",3.5
"If school can offer options to students to finish school at home is great because they want students can learn and give them more opportunities. Students can be more benefit if they attend to school and they can learn more than to did at home. Also there are many students can't come to school because they have a job and they have to did school at home. Students are not that much of prepare if they did school at home. If students could attend to school it can be great for them to be more able to did more prepared them for the future. Also that can get opportunities if they attend to school and good reviews from teachers.

If students attend to school there are more ways to learn. Also students can be more able to ask more question to teachers. If they did classes from home that are not able to ask a lot of question and they can't met friend who can be a big help for them. If you attend to school also teachers can prepared you more and they talk to you if you did wrong in classes. All teachers in school i believe that they can see your capacity or level that you are and at home they just give you work and they didn't know anything about the student. The teacher at school can see the way that you better learn and they can work with the student to don't fell classes because the know you better if you go to school. Home school is a great idea for people that can't come to school.

In the world are students that can't attend to a school because they have a job or others problems to go to school. In the world is not only one single reason to don't attend to school. Many of the students that can't attend to school in the United States of America is because they work and this work can't give opportunity to attend to school. Sometimes they don't attend to school because is hard to work and wake up in the mornings to go to school. They also many times prefer to do school at home because they maybe have physical problems and they feel better if they did at home. Many students can't come to school but if they did at home this shows that they are planing to graduate even if they don't receive a good chance to learn more.

Students at home are not learning what they can learn in school. They are not very prepared if they did school at home because sometimes teachers give activities with friends and students can learn from that activities or presentations of projects that the whole class did it. School also you can practice more if you are learning and at home you can't practice what you learn. If you are learning English and you did school at home if they speak other language that is not English you can't practice it. If you did school at home there are also many distractions that you can't concentrate and if you are not concentrated in what your working on you are not going to understand what you are doing. If you are in a classroom teachers make sure that you are concentrated in your own work and they also make sure that you are doing right that why students who attend to schools can be more prepared than students who did school at home.

In conclusion if you have time and the opportunity to attend to school you should do it because you will learn and get more opportunities. If you can't attend to a school and you are doing school at home you must concentrated in your work and don't get distracted. Also if you are receiving school at home you must find some one who you can work with to practice. The opportunity that many school offer is a great idea. School wants to students can complete their dreams even if they can't assist to a school. But the schools are giving opportunities to finish at home and must students should appreciate that because school is thinking about the future of the society. In fact school programs are working for people who really want to have opportunities and make their dreams true.",3.0
"I agree with this way to learn and study. I think that is a good idea for many students that can't coming to the school or have a work.

One of the benefits is that the students can wake up late, because the class is online so, you can take the class in the afternoon, you can stay in your home relax in the bed also if you want eate you can do.

Some guys work in the morning, in the night or all the day.

I have a friend that he work of

8am to 5pm and he always is tired and this can help his, for the future.

He can study in the night and have his class with tranquillity.

Some people think that this a way to lose the time, but I do't think so.

Because I believe that you can be a profesional person if you want.

My friend don,t wanna work in a restauran all the time, he want to be a mechanic and if he take class online his dream can be convert a reality.

In conclusion I believe that if you want something if have a dream, you need to follow your dreams I don't care if is hard NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE.

If you have the opportunity you need to take it.",3.0
"Would students benefit from taking classes home? Some would agree and disagree. Taking classes online would help students who need that one on one teaching. Some students have a hard time focusing in a noisy environment because other students are disturbing the class whiles they are trying to pay attention.

Students who aren't comfortable in a noisy environment cant express themselves in class,but if you take classes online you get to express yourself for example video confrence you get to express yourself and ask good question with good explanation. Because everybody has a way of learning some students adapt quick and others learn slowly,but taking this one on one course helps you adapt really quick because you are alone in a quite environment which is going to help you adapt really quick! Online classes also helps because some students have a hard time waking up early in the morning to school which causes you to be late everytime,being late can lead you to detention,saturday school and other things. But with this online course you can take it anytime during the day. Mainly my point is online classes are very helpful and it helps students to concentrate more.

Some students would disagree to take classes online because some people have a fast away of adapting. Some students like to interact with others,students like to experience the high school life.

Do you think would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? It all depends on the ways the student learns.                                 ",3.5
"I think is a good choice for people to take classes online or at home because they can learn more and concentrate better and put more attention and nobody can distract them. I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and don't be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn.

some people prefer to take classes from home or online. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and don't concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that.

When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and don't putting attention or sleeping in class. But the people who studies online or at home they are ready know a lot because they were concentrated and no one was distracting them and that if how they work someones want to learn and pass and someones no each one can take their own decision. I think studies online is more better, more productive at the and of the year. Taking classes at home can benefit at the students in many ways and they know more at the end of the school. When the students at the regular school at the end of the year they have an SOL test. some students fail this test because they did not learn nothing for the rest of the year just for be sitting and doing nothing. But if someone who studies at home have the ability to pass the SOL because they were interested of the class of what were they learning and don't have distractions all year. ",3.0
"I believe that students attending school from home will benefit for many different reasons. Students who experience anxiety attacks, depression, bullying, or just not being able to attend school for the day will find great use in online school, they can connect with their classes or teachers without being in school and not have to miss out on important information or work. Students are able to be in a safe environment at home if they do not feel comfortable in school.

Furthermore, students with anxiety or depression may have a harder time going through out the school day then their peers. For example, my girlfriend who has very often panic attacks, dislikes attending her current school. She was a new transfer student to the school and was also new to the school itself. She found it hard to not have anybody to go to and vent during the school day which causes her to stress and have anxiety. Moreover, she gets very often panic attacks during the day which makes her not want to come to school more often. She finds it easier and safer to stay at home. When ever we're on the phone over face time, she's always doing her class work that she takes home to complete. She's a hardworking student and always does her work but because of the environment she's in, it limits her on what she is capable of.

Not only that it would help students feel secure, but for the students who are sick for the day and cannot attend school, wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. For example; there are days where I just feel weak and tired but I wouldn't want to miss a review day for a major test the next class. If there was online school, I would be able to connect with my teacher and the classes from home where I feel comfortable. Also, my mom wouldn't have to worry that i'm failing my classes because i'm not showing up to them. I believe that other students would agree with me on this argument because almost everyone I know, wishes they could attend school from home.

Moreover, adults might not have knowledge of this, but let me tell you; there is a lot of drama and rumors in every high school. No matter where it is, the policies it has, the advances of the students, there is drama. And drama is one major factor on why students wishes to attend school at home. Just Imagine the advances of our present civilization if there was no drama at school, and no have you heard this or have you heard that. Drama and rumors are big time distractions to daily school work and it peaks the interest of every student. By enabling online school, students dedicated to become scholars are able to take this distraction out of their equation. They can attend school without dealing with the big mouths talking up and down and all around the school.

Overall, distance learning has a very good impact on the students. Students feel safer at home, and when they are sick or cannot attend school for they day, they wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. Online school would be very beneficial for everyone.",4.5
"Is good idea for students to recive online courses. In my point of veiw, it will be better for students to attend to regulars classes at schools. In this way students will be able to socialize with other people. Also, they will have the opportunity to do other activities. In this days sudents recive free education and it is easy for them to attend to school. Online programs may have a cost for the courses or classes.

if students attend to schools they will learnd more about their classes because teachers will be able to teach them with enthusiasm. In the other hand, is good idea to recive classes online but you will not have the opportunity to interac with teachers or other students. If you go to school there will be a way that you can make new friends that you can share adventures and stories with them. It will be more benefit for students who go to school than students who stay at home watching their scream on the computer.

Attening school also give you the option to enroll many activies. For example, you can join the football team. music band, and the theater shows. I know a friend that he didn't like to attend school, but when he start to play for the football team at his local school, he was more exiting to speen time at school. At school you can do many actiivities. In contrast, reciving classes online can be a good option for does students that don't have the resources to go to school. For example, if they don't have a bus stop or the school is to far away. Also, for the students with special disability.

The united states have the advantage to have free education. This is a good thing for does parents with not reasourses. Parents can send students to school without worry for a monthly payment. They know that their children are in a good learning place. In the other hand, having classes online may cost a amount of your money. It will be difficult for students because they will have to find a job to soport their online paymants for the courses. In this way have classes online is not a better option for all.

Offering distance learning as an opion for students is not a good advantage for all the people who want to study. it's because many students prefer to attend to school than staying at home.

It's a good thing interac with your teachers or other students at shool.           ",3.0
"Do you think students should work on assignments from school at home?

In this prompt

I will argue about how students can study from long distance, not all schools approve the current subject. If students were to study from home it would be difficult for them to understand what the assignment that is being asked to complete at certain time. The students should be able to afford a device which is necessary to study any subject. Attending classes from home can cause for students to be able to work more and do their assignments on time.

Schools will not exist if students leave to study home which will make it hard for them to communicate with teachers when help is needed. Students would not meet each other or talk physically which would be awkward, can cause them to not trust each other if it comes to a project that needs to be done. Physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. In many short word students will be gaining so much weight that they'll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination.

Typing online or video conferencing is not easy if the person on camera is shy and doesn't like video conferencing which can be very often. Accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device. Testing online can be easy to cheat if the teacher is not around walking and watching what your doing. Students might not know many things but cheating and being sneaky are the two most known words we understand very well.

In other words there are advantages to studying online, disadvantages online and it would be a big disappointment for students to fail almost every class that needs to be taken for graduation. If they have a job they will consider work their first priority instead of school. Student's would not receive a scholar ship or diploma so that they can go to college and accomplishing the goal of having a better job.

Some people say that school is very important for students, that they'll earn more money than their parents who probably dont have a well paid job and education. But I think it can benefit sometimes it can be a amazing idea for students to study home because they won't drop out of school. Students have different emotions that trigger them to want to leave school behind, since they start working more to pay bills that need to be paid each month.

All students should go to school to focus on what they want to be in life or do. Physical experience is not the same as typing online or video conference. Knowing that student's can succeed in different ways is not bad even so they will be expected to have any sort of education someday in the future. School is providing knowledge for those who pay attention to school and more. Believing you can do what you always dreamed of is a motivation that will help learn more about life and the way it works.     ",4.0
"Some schools offer the option of attending classes by ""online"" or ""video conferencing"". This may not be a good idea because how does the student going to get responsible? or how can the teachers know if the student is not cheating on a test?. Is there any benefit to know is this option is going to help the student phsychlogy, mentally or physically?. Education is too important! And a better way of learning is by attending to SCHOOL! The way as many people done it. Also, by this way attending to school students might join in sports, activities, etc. It gives more benefits and helps to refresh your mind. School gives classes of ""PE"" which is important because doing sports is healthy.

In 2015, a student at Generic_School took the option to attend classes by online because the student was not a ""social"" person which means the student did not like to communicate. But after all the student did regret it. The student noticed that communication is too important because is part of education and how to success in life. The words of the student to advice the students were "" There is no more benefits than attending to school. School does help you to your knowdlegde and prepare you for your future. Did not like the fact of waking up too early and to deal with all those people every single day, but here is the thing as people we cannot avoid people. It does affect you plus It does not make sense at all. Why? because WE ARE THE PEOPLE. What I learned by taking this option and what made me regret it was : We are the community, we are the voice of the world and as a group working together we can make big changes and a better society as well. And classes from home by the way online or video conferencing, this does not give you ""P.E"" classes and doing sports is wealthy. So by now attending to school is the best option for everyone."" The student had excellent grades, scholarships, made new friends than he expected to have. Where is he now by making the best option? He is now at SCHOOL_NAME preparing for his major as a lawyer. He became an example for many students that have the same issues as he had.

As an immigrant this is a real big request, they must attend classes by going to school. It is too important because the lack of language and credits are needed. United States is an immigrant country and their schools has these excellents programs called ""Esol"". Of course, immigrants need these kind of help. They need to get involved by attenting to school. Why? Many immigrants come to this country to have a better future, they absolute have different customs, a different kind of thoughts, etc. So that infers a lot more than you think...Especially, each country have a different system's programs for graduation like in South America you only need to pass all of your classes for graduation, but how many classes are they? More than 17 classes. In United States you need to pass all of your classes plus the SOLS. This is the reason why immigrants must attent to school, It does help you to refresh your mind, to have new thoughts, new experiences, and to know what you need for graduation. Its is hard because Immigrants needs an esol teacher and to not attend to normal classes for awhile as long as you learn the language.That is why it takes a little longer for them to graduate and that is why they do need to attent to school. To understand much better the topics of each SOL class because they do need credits as any student. Otherwise if they choose the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is not going to help them as much as the school will.

In conclusion, a better learning is by attending classes from school because school give you more opportunites, more methods of learning, to socialized, to communicate. It inpires you to keep going and to have an idea of what you want your future to be like. Which means it prepares you for life. Any issue that you have they will help you to work on it, to find a solution. Like this student did not like to communicate at all, but he noticed that attending to school is the best option because it gives you the ideas of what you want to do, the opportunity to meet the college you want to go. To know what you can do to improve yourself! Also, It helps immigrants to learn the language with this program to pass your SOL classes to graduate, they receive a double help from school. Going to school has more benefits than you think so you need to fight for it because anything in this life is not easy, but is worth it.

"The program that the school provides for attending classes online could have a positive outcome or it could have a negative outcome. Different school have different ways of doing things. Some school don't provide this type of programs, in others do. Different type of people have different type of view of attending classes online. People would agree that is a good idea but other would say its bad idea. Having online class you don't have to wait for other people to finish. You could do what pace you want and to do your classes. It could have a negative part to attending online school. Your WIFI could go slow or not work at all. Having a hard time to achieve the work. Not having a different environment with people with the same age. Not doing the work that they assigned you.

When a student have class online they could find it defalcate to achieve the work that they been assigned to. You would not be able to ask question about the problem. Would have to figure it out by your self. Some online website would not help you to achieve what you are looking for. It could give a bad answer and then you got the whole assignment wrong. In videos you could find ways to achieve it but sometimes there is not a lot of videos on things that you are looking for. If you where in a class room you could ask a teacher to show you how to solve it and you would probably would understand it more. In online school sometimes there is no teacher available at the time when you need them. Sometimes student don't have the time and sometimes they don't turn in there work on time. Would just put it to the side and say"" they would probably do it later"" and never do it. It could be found defalcate to achieve the work on time.

When you so round your self with people that are the same age. You could have study patterns and you could ask them for help. Doing online school its just you and the computer and the class you are taking. Probably have friends but they mite not be taking the same class as you,would not be a able to work together or study. Doing online school would maybe not have time to socialize with new people. You may work or do other things but most of the times they could be older or you just don't talk to people a lot. Having different environment could help you to learn more and plus you would not be by your self. Have other people with you in the same room. Not just you home by yourself with a computer. Having classes online you would not be sou round with people your age.

Doing online class sometimes could give out a lot of work to do in one day. In the same day you have to turn it in. It could be challenge when you dont know what they are talking about or you just don't understand it. Doing your work is one important thing to do, to understand the class and what its teaching. Not just going online to find something that kind of looks like the work and you just copy it down. Sometimes student could get lazy and not do there work. Would probably leave it for the last minute to turn it in. The laziness of student could end up with no good grades or passing the class, would take the class all over. You could get distracted really fast with other things that is going on in your life. Not doing the work, it would not take you no where and would not finish the class on time before the due date.

The school would give different ways for student to attend class. It could be online class or going to a classroom in a school. It would be helpful for student to attend more class and probably have more free time. Sometimes student could take advantage on this program to just stay home and do nothing. Life could be hard sometimes and you could go through things that you don't expect to happen. It could be defalcate when you don't know the subject and there is no teacher around to help you. Students always choose whats right for them. Attending classes online could be defalcate to achieve. Would not be sou rand by people their age and probably not do there work.

"Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by student getting to much school work that cannot all be handied in on night. Every day kids complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at school gaing more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at schools helps kids succeeed and have better grades.

One of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime, and anywhere. Children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. The students can work around the parents schedule instead of the parents working around the student's schedule. Some students have a trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pase set by teachers. Homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homerschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules. The students can focus on their studies.

When you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit students. Learning from home won't have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment their are not familiar with, which makes the feel uncomfortable. If a students learns from home they will feel more relaxed and confortable and won't stress about work. In a school, you are struck at desk for 6 hours and have a limited time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This is not help a student's learning at all. On the other hand. If you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want.

There are still a few reasons not to do distanced learning. There are many more opportunities with public schools. People from different colleges don't go to students'homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public school are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school funding for public schooling willl fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of buged cuts. In public schools, depending an the teachers, cheating is hard to do.

My conclusion is students should be offered classes online or at home because the environment is less distracting, which could be less stressful. At home there are less distractions, rather than at school where there are many different thing to students, can greatly affect the quality of a student's work.",3.5
"Some school offer distances learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think student would not be benefit if they had distances learning. Many student would not focused during the lesson they would just do whatever they want so they won't learn as much as if they had a teacher. If student had online classes they would not get the attention necessary if they need help.

Some student often have a bad day so they often don't pay attention and they just don't do the work that is assigned to them. they often just search the answer without learning but they think that's okay because no one is watching them. Many of them don't learn the subject but still somehow they passed the class. Other Important, reason why student won't benefit from online classes is that the may have some big problem in their life and they need someone to talk to but their one home so they feel sad, but if they were in school they can talk to a teacher,coach,counselor, or any other they feel happy to talk too. Other student may be sad they don't have someone to talk too.

Online classes don't benefit students because they don't have the help they need. When student take online they can paid someone to do their work, and pretend that they did the work. One reason they can ask their brother to the work for them so they are not really learning anything. Other example, student may request some extra help but they won't get it because they don't a teacher with them. so they just don't understand but when it comes to do the text they failed. Other example might be that they are having family problem so they won't do the online classes. And they would not be focus. Having online classes won't help student in their life. one example is that they won't have friends and when they go to the real world they are going to have trouble talking to people because they don't know how too. Other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. Most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they don't have the opportunity to chat with them.

When students get video conferencing they don't really understand because something the video don't really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . School should not have video conferencing.

Student are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes.. one reason they going to feel bad is that they did not enjoy high school life. let's Image if a student was really good at soccer or any other sport and if they had played high school they could of get a scholarship, and maybe become one of greatest,

but they did'it because they were talking online classes. school should not have online classes because it take the right of student in playing high school sport.

Overall, student would not benefit from online classes. they won't learn that much at home, and student need the attention to do work, they also need people to help them with their work. In my personal option school should not have online classes or video conferencing. Student are going to have a better knowledge if they go to school and, they work with teacher. School should let student enjoy take their high school life and not have online classes.",3.0
"Does student really benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because I once had a friend who attended classes from home she never did what she was suppose to do she took that as an advantage to do other things that she needed to do she didn't benefit at all. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they take advantage of it, they don't do what their suppose to do, and they don't learn nothing.

First of all, student take the advantage of attending classes from home to do other things that they need to do. For example turning in stuff late that were long due, not all student that attend classes from home take it as an advantage but those who do they just take more advantage just to have fun and not do the work that they are suppose to be doing. Another thing is they will always try to come up with an excuse of why they didn't do the assignment that they were suppose to do. They take advantage of the time they have to go out with friends to party, to hang out with their boyfriend, and to do other things that are non-school related.

Most importantly, they don't do what their suppose to do, when they get an assignment or project that their suppose to do they just act lazy and not do it cause they know nobody for example, like their teacher wont be telling them to do the work. They will spend most of their time doing other stuff instead of the work that they need to be done with. Students will spend more time partying, hanging with their friends instead of actually doing the work that they need to do which will actually help them later on. Most students actually know the stuff they just preferred not to do any of the work cause they don't feel like doing it.

Finally, The students actually don't learn nothing by attending classes from home all they do is just party, hang out with their friends and boyfriend. They actually don't do any of the work that they are assign to do they just cheat by copying it off of someone or get the answers from the internet. Most student they attend classes from home as an opportunity to have fun and to take a break from school, they literally will learn nothing cause all they do is play around when they are suppose to take things seriously they just want to party all day long and not care about any of the stuff that they are suppose to be studying.

In closing, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they take advantage of it to do other things that they need to do, they don't do what their suppose to do they don't do their work as suppose to do, and they don't learn nothing all they do is party, hang out with their friends and boyfriend they don't do none of the things that they are assign to do.

"Yes I agree with this quote, beacuse every students have a chance to learn, so in my opinion, I think that is a great opportunity, for all of them to learn. Some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. I think some of them they have a chance to surpport they family.

Maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too.

I think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress.

First of all I think it's would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you.

Secondly if you have some family problem or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school.

An other opportunity is if you go to college and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning fron 8 AM to 4 PM, and you job schedule is at 1 PM to 11 pm .

At that time you have this big opportynity to sturdy and learning online, before work and you have some time left to do your homework, or other thing that you have to or you want to do in that day.

It's not noly online you take the class online but, you will have a viedo conferencing to motivate you, that if you not understand, that can explain it to you.

The school give them a big opportunity to progress, to have a good education and a better future.

For me it is a great option for them to attend it.",3.0
"I would think that some student's would stay home so they can catch up on things they need but some stay so they can get the help they really need. For example if a parent see's his child struggling they could ask their child and be like do you need help or what do you want us to do to help you. I'm pretty sure that some students are gonna take this opportunity, and take online classes or get the help they need from a teacher or someone they know who can help them. The real reason that I think they will do it is because they would want to graduate from school so they can get the diploma and be happy that they did it with the help of a parent. Yes, I do believe that student's would benefit with taking classes at home or by online classes with a video conferencing. Student's should be grateful that some school's are giving them the opportunity to take some classes at home or even with a teacher they can video chat with and they can help them too. If it wasn't for the school who was giving us the privilege do take this opportunity for the help then we wouldn't be passing anything or getting the help we need. For example, if a student goes to the school and tell's them hey i'm having trouble getting this subject i know for sure the teacher are gonna give them a choice to pick if they want help or take online classes at home with like a teacher who's helping them. Another reason kids ask for help is because they probably ask at home and sometimes's parent's dont have the time to help them cause they are tired from work or they just tell them to ask someone else and then they don't get the help they need. For some student's it's easy for them but for some it isn't easy so some students can help each other so they can understand it. For other reason's it's better for kids to try on there own first and then if they still dont get it then they ask for the help or ask the teacher for help at the same time. In conclusion i think it's a good idea that the school can give the benefit for student's to take online classes so they can get the help they need.

"I don't think it would benefit students to attend classes from home by online such as video conference Why? because they would get distracted by anything else at home and also they wouldn't have the chance to experience what it would be like in school.

If they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. They also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. They could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that. When you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. You could easily get distracted by things at home even say I dont want to do it anymore and I feel like thats the risk it would take if students are allowed to take classes at home online.

Students also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. The chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. It would also help students for the real world because when you work you can't do it from home on a computer. You actually have to show up to work and work with others. You also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you can't at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you can't at home. Have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. When you are at home,wouldn't you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. Yes it's a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also it's boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers.

I understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they can't keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. Being home may help them do better then at school I understand but I think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school. I personally don't think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what it's like.

Therefor I don't think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing. Student should attend school and experience it all not be home distracted and miss many chances to learn new things and socialize with peers. Maybe even discover what they are good and take that for their future.        ",3.5
"Most of the times, the students don't get the help they need by the school. The reason for this is because some teachers don't really care about whether the students are learning or not, but about their money. Also, some students get bullied by other students and there is no one who could defend them. This happens in a many schools, such as schools in Mexico, United States, Central America, etc. So, in my opinion, attending classes at home is a great option for the students.

Classes online, well known as ""homeschooling"", is a method in which students can do the assignment of their classes at home in their computer. This idea emerged because there is many conflicts that school has to deal with, for example discrimination, and violence and between the students. So, thanks to the advances of technology, the school can provide their services at home. Is a great method, but not as going to the school, sit in your chair and learn. This method has its advantages, but also its disadvantages.

One of the advantages attending classes online is that is more comfortable and secure for the students. For example, the rate for shooting will be reduced, and the students will not suffer any discrimination against other students. Another reason are that it is less stressful because the students would more time to complete any work. Also, it helps the students to better subject. For example, students can watch videos about any specific subject, observe the procedures, and replay them if they are confused. Also parents can supervise their children and help them if they need, and they would not have to worry about attendances.

Classes online are a great benefit for students but they their disadvantages as well. For example there will be no jobs for teachers who really want to teach, share experiences to their students, and help them to improve in their lives. Another example is that students would not communicate with other students and would not know the importance of Team Work. Also, they would not have an experience by doing activities (such as playing sports, instruments, going to filmstrips, etc,)

which help them to develop useful skills. Another disadvantage is that schools would not have alternate classes that helps them to chose the career they want to. For example construction, cosmetics, arts, music, engineering, technology, etc.

In conclusion, attending classes online is a great method, but not as much as going to the school. The school is always going to be a learning center. If the school applies more fair rules, the students would feel more safety and gain a lot of confidence. Also, the school has to have better teachers who really want to help their students and not teachers that only care about their job. Anyways, the school helps us to get right path for our lives, so without it, we would not the education we need to improve in our lives and in the world.        ",3.5
"In my opinion students should come to school. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students,which allows the students to be irresponsibles and not to show their work to the teacher. As we can see taking classes online is not a good option to us, for instance if we dont make the time to attend the classes online, or by the time we are taking the online classes we received a text for friend we stop doing what we are doing and got distracted by the electronic devices and, others words if we come to school received classes we are going to be able to get the knowledge that we need to be great in our academic life.

I consider myself that taking online classes is not a good option for students. Some students that take online classes are procrastinators,they dont care about their homework, or they wait until the last minute to do it. The truth is, if we dont take our online classes seriously how we are going to learn. For example,

My friend Generic_Name is taking online classes and she said that taking online classes allow her to be irresponsible by not doing her homework.

Some students dont make the time to take the online classes and we just forget to take it. I wonder how we are going to learn if we dont make the time to do it. Sometimes we got distracted for something that have nothing to with the class that we are taking. However, if we have a job and we got home late, and in our mind is to get home and take the online classes, but when we get home we are so tired and we just want to go to bed, and forget about what we have to do.

The last and more important reason what we should take classes in school is, if we attend to school,we can ask questions to the teacher and he can provides us with a powerful answers and specific examples, if we attend to school that will helps us to get a responsibility to be every day at school and not to miss any important class, and also that would gives the knowledge that we would need to be great in life.

In final consideration I think students should come to school and take our classes, that way we would learn more better than taking it in online, and also that we will makes us more responsible. As we take the classes in school we will get the knowledge that we would need to success in our academic life in general we would be great in our professional life.  ",2.5
"Some students who live far away from their schools; they prefer to attend classes from their home instead of going to a school, attending classes from their home can affect some students education and affect their live in a future beacuse not all of the students who are taking online classes are going to complete their work .In my opinion I think is a bad idea to attend classes from your home because students can get distracted for anything, not complete their work and get bad grades.

If we have online class it can be hard to these people who got distracted for anything .Once I had a friend her name was Generic_Name, and she had a online math class that she needed to be able to graduated. One day I went to her home like at 6:00 pm after shool and she was working in her online class, but honestly Generic_Name was not really woking in what she suppose to be working on, yes she had her cumputer on and her online class open , but she was getting distracted by the her tv show just because she like the beaty and the best she stop doing her work. My friend Generic_Name she suppose to do her work but she always got distarcted by her tv show, if she had deside to turned off her tv she didn't got distarcted by anything and she could be success in her online class.

Students who attend classes from their home as there is anyone who is reminding them to completen the work some of them forgot to get it done and they had an incomplete work. This year I am taking an online class and sometimes I forget that I have to be doing all my requested assingments, and by the end of last week I got a bad score because i didn't complete my Vocabulary assingment. If I had put a alarm every day to remind me that i have tostudy and complete my asssiments i could get a better score.

Some others will say that attending classes from home can be a good idea because they can work on in any time,however,others may say that is a bad idea beacuse they can get bad grades. Some classmate that are taking online classes they aren't reading all the directions that the class is giving ;they are just doing the work without reading and that can affect their grades. Having bad grades can made you to not pass your school year, but if we efort we can be great.

For some students is consider to take online classes, but in some point can affect them in their education. There are many students who have online classes and they are falling because they dont have enough help, and some of they because they are not doing it .If schools provide after schools help for online classes will be helpful for all student who needed to be more success, and feel more confortable while they are doing their work and also teachers to be cheking if students are able to pass.

"I oppose the idea of schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes,this is because not all students benefit from attending classes from home,and online.

Giving students the choice to attend classes online is a big responsibility; Causing the demand that they must follow instructions,and complete class work tasks. It is true that most students have no problem with this , they complete their agenda and assignments; Thus why they are more comfortable with this method of learning. But this method of learning is not always the case for some students, because it gives this students an opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes; Consequently, they start to fool around and get distracted at times. Attitudes like this can lead to: not meeting up with deadlines, missing daily classworks, poor understanding skills, and ultimately failure. Students that have poor learning skills would be incompetant to take online classes, Which mean at all costs their must be guidance for this kind of students. It is possible that due to a lack of connection with the Teacher in the classroom and the student, it is most likely they would not have the chance to ask further questions or recieve reliable advices from a teacher. In some cases students can benefit from seeking assurance from other students with more knowlegde about the subject, group activites ,and asistance.

In conclusion, distance learning and it's method of teaching is not helpful to every student, because a stystem of learning that benefits all students,and give students opportunity for futher understanding is more beneficial.",3.0
"Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference. Schools have brought distance learning in their system for students can do their assignments from home. Many people think this is a great idea and some oppose to this learning method. The schools can see if they are on track or online to their classes but if they arn't in the online class they will be behind in their assignments. Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student?

The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosen't feel like doing it. Students who don't do their assignments they wait until they are at school because in school you arn't distracted like at home you are concentrated and ready to work. Is distance learning beneficial for students at home? for some students it might be but for many it isn't.

Is online learning at home beneficial for students? some students do think its beneficial and a really great idea. Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they don't get the question that is being asked. Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task. Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. Distance learning isn't capable of doing what you do in a classroom. Is distance learning really beneficial?

Is being taught in a classroom more beneficial for students? many students prefer being taught by a teacher than online. Students are more productive and they share their thoughts and explanations in that specific assignment than online classroom. All the students are in the same page and all gathering more information by writing notes and being concentrated in their tasks. Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers.

Students have their own way of learning, it doesn't matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesn't matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you. The students who prefer distance learning really do it at home and feel like they are learning mush more at than in a classroom. Students who enjoy learning in a classroom like being around peers and want knowledge from everyone around them. They are both beneficial for that specific student.     ",3.5
"According to the Washington Post, there has been an increase in student population in schools around the U.S. they are being crowed with more and more students every year. Because of this more students in the future will need to take online classes at home instead of going to the school and doing so. Being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. Distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. Because of the fact the students don't have to go and spend time at the actual school. The travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house.

A reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. If you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. Another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. The way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school.

This could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. For example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. Something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The U.S. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. Distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. If there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. A easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. In the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day I had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. In those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school.

In some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. A reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. Another thing would be that their are less things that could distract you from completing work. For example when you are at home you have all your computers, phone, TV, and things like a Xbox that could get you distracted or off topic. When you are at school their are friends that can distract you to but when you are in class it is hard to do anything else besides work. The reason is that your teacher won't let you go on your phone or talk to your friends as much before you finish with your in class assignment. A Benefit from going to school is that a lot of the things that you learn come from talking or hearing it from people at school. So if you attend classes at home instead of going to school it impacts some things that you could actually learn from going to school. A lot of the things I have learned in my past is from talking or asking a friend how to complete an assignment, if you are at home and have nobody to talk to it is not as beneficial as it is going to school.

The fact being that their are benefits from learning at home and learning at school. Because when you are at home you can get distracted easier cause their is no teacher that is watching over you to complete your assignments. But when you are at school you are surrounded by other kids that could talk to you and disturb you on doing your work. Their are pros and cons in both situations but having the option to attend classes at home is better than not having the ability to. Because of that I think that distance learning is better in most cases cause it gives you more options in how you can complete work.",4.0
"Techonology has becoming powerful that let students and teachers to give and receive classes online. Disadvantages or adventages of taking classes online? These question are faced today by students deciding taking online classes. Often students work part or full time jobs while going to school or collage so their time is valuable. these students want to make the right decisions in choosing classes so knowing the disaventage and adventages is important. I believe that online classes is a good opportunity for students as it gives flexibility, they often offer any type of class desired and provide access to faculty, and they often offer accelerate courses.

To begin with, one of the best adventage of online classes is flexibility. A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. While there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the student's desire. Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule. Many students work on afternoon. The flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules.

Secondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. Distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. A person can simply use the google to find a class. While most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately.

Lastly, Online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assigments based on their own person schedules. The fact is online classes offer flexibility and conveniece that are often vital to students who work and have families. In addition, many students are looking for classes that are advanced to complete the course faster. The best way to advance in the class is to make it online because in the regular schools it takes a long time as there are students who get behind and the teachers wait for them since everyone has to go at the same time.

To conclude, with online classes, students do all the work at their own pace. As long as they meet their deadlines and participate apropriately online. Also, studying online requires more self motivation and time mangement skills because students will spend a lot of time on their own without someone physically close to keep them focused on deadlines. Online course will not only teach students geology or poetry, it will also help them become more self motivated, a trait that will make them stand out in the workplace and beyond. It will teach educators to be mature choosing right decisions as it will make them explore more and be students with an open mind.         ",4.0
"Sometimes take classes from home not can be helf students to improve their learning. Although some schools offer distances learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. I disagree to students take the classes on home because they not learn the same as in the school, if students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking, and Students did not have the same opcion like others students.

The students who take classes from home, not learn the same in the school and this can be are difficult for them. For example, most of students lose the test because they forget the impormation that they learn in online classes and the time of the test they not remember enyting. Sincerity, take classes from home it is difficult for students the short learning because they not have the same capacity like others students. The students can be improve in the school more that from home, because from home they teaching they self. In addition, most of school believe that give classes from home can be helf students, but this is a big error.

If the students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking since, they answer themself. For example, sometimes the students do not know how to make homework, project, etc and they need someone to helf them. Also, every students need a teacher to explain everything that they need to make, and if they make the classes from home is impossible to make the thing good if did not have a teacher. It not the same to make the calsses online or in school because in online it is person who teaching for only a short moment, nevertheless in the school the teacher teaching for like 8 hours and helf in sonthing that students need. In effect,

some students do not have capacity to make the classes from home, they needing to make the classes in the school to learn more.

Students did not have the same opcion like others students like the time or the learning. For example, most of them have a job and they not have the time to take the classes from home, because they lose the time in the job and when they going to the home they are tired and only going to sleep. While, the others students improve their life in the schools the others students who make the classes onlone not learn enything because they not have time. Make the classes from home it is not necesary for students because they can going to school every day and work after school and with this method they have more chance to improve they learning. Truly, The school give the option but the students have the choice.

In conclutiong, they not learn in the classes from home that in the school, and this can be affect tehir learning. They teaching themself because in home tehy do not have a teacher to helf them. THey not have same opportinity like others students because they can be not have time to make the all thing. Some school have this option but it is not a good idea for students because they not focus in online classes and they fail.  ",2.5

RE: Classes online

Not bacause I take classes online many of the students will not be responsible and they miss many grades, They will even have not internet in online classes for be doing their own things at home for example, if i have online classes i would be distranted by my brother or other things and i feel that my online classes is not would not be good idea like i say that online class is not a good idea there are many distraction. also, if we have that problem I think that beging with teachers is the best idea cause they help us a lot in the amies.

The firs reason is not all student have the internet in the houses some students don't have the internet because their parents don't have too much money to but one or maybe because they don't have the tecnology. One friend told me that their parents think that the tecnology is bad for him because it is distraction and he needs to focus on his future. and if he dosen't take that class online he will fall that class. every parents think different.

Another reason because not all student are not responsibles. some student came to school but they don't do anything' but it the teacher letf them that they need to do this, they do it, because they feel pressure and they know that the fall the class but is their class is online they will no care about the class, And they don't will take care about the class.

The conclusion is tha bad idea take classes online because the internet is one of the things that they need it, anbd not all the students have it, they need to have their responsability the class and not to all the student care for their classes, and the last thing is because not al the students like to have classes online because they know that they can't consentrate in their house bacause all the noise around.

"Some schools are offering distance learning for students to attend class from home. With online or video conferencing . I support thus idea of distance classes Because you can wake up anytime you want, Go in a slow speed to no overwhelm yourself, no one can bother you while you study.

First of you can wake up anytime you want so you can have the right amount of hours in case you work at night and you dont get seven to nine hours of sleep every night. Also you can do classes later in the day in case you want to work in the morning instead of the night. So you can have a career and have time to study to make your future come closer. It's also a good thing for people that have to stay home to look at after their sick parents or little brothers they won't have to worry at school if they are okay because they will be home taking classes and making sure everything is okay while studying.

Therefore they won't be overwhelmed about missing days or which classes he needs to make up a test or if he/she has a project coming up in class because all of that info is going to be in his/her phone or laptop. Its a better thing to have online classes doesn't take up half of your day you dont get overwhelmed with new info for like 4 different classes in one day. So you wont be stressed out as much that (study shows most kids that drop out is because they are being stressed out with so many info in just one day for like 4 different blocks in a single day). Online classes are better from what i heard it help's you better cause it teaches you what the state want's you to know instead of things you dont need to know like some side stories that teachers say to make you try to remember but end up getting lost in the story.

Finally when you do your work no one can bother you about the answer or what problem you in and they cant cheat off of you and you end up getting in trouble because they didnt stop asking or taking to you. Its also a good thing because if you don't understand you can go back a lesson to relearn it again in case you forgot how to do the problem. thats why Online classes are more proffered then actual class when you have to wake up early and go to school all tired cause you only slept a little staying up because of work or studding for the next unit so you cant fall behind or re doing a new untie while going into a new one. So i support the idea of distance learning for students and that schools are thinking about doing it would be a great idea.",3.5
"I think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. I agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you wont feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you dont have to show up to school anymore so youll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. My final reason is if someone if decides to go to college they'll be ready because thats how college is online.

Think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have 25mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? well that wont have to be the case anymore because doing online means youll be going at your paste and you wont have to rush to turn things in. For example, I take an online class, so for me I already know how it works and honestly I think its way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or I dont have to turn in incomplete work. so I like doing the online class is also fun because I be at home while doing my work in my bed.

Rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? Well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. Thats right, dont have to wake up early and go to school. Just chill at home in your bed and do your work. Thats why i agree that we should have online classes because Ill enjoy my bed and do my work from home.

finally, last but not least college. if you ever plan to go to college then best believe that college is online class and video conferencing. Nothing new go to the library and study from there who wouldnt like that.?

In conclution online classses and video conferencing is the best way of learning. yes they benefit from learning and it helps them out. ",3.0

My Second reason is about me whiles i was growing up. Since the i was born coming up, my mom said to me the day you start going to school Henry make it your own.

"Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conference. This might be a good option for students who really do need it but there is some other students who won't take this seriously.

I am writing this essay with the porpuse of desagreement with the idea of providing this ""benefit"" to the students, this is a way of making students lose interest in school because they might think that they don't have to take the conference every time and they willl think that they can do it whenever they want which gives to think that they aren't prepare for making good decisions when it comes with schools classes. In my opinion this is an opportunity that the schools gives to the students to drop out of high school considering that students are teenagers and they don't have the same amount of responsability than adults in most cases.

As a student I desagree with this option. We need to be able to communicate, create good group work, and meet people and I can assure that most of the students will ended up leaving this classes when they half way done. Being with more students make classes fun, helpful and even more interesting, students sometimes needs to have a adult teaching them and having a conversation face to face instead a computer taking to them.

Taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time for example: My brother is a college student who is getting his master degree in Genetic Engineering some of his classes wasn't a requirement that he had to take them inside school so he decide to take them online so he can have more free time when it comes with work and school. He made a study plan which consist in spending one hour each day so he can focus on his online classes which helps him to study for every single of his classes.

My friend Generic_Name is a senior on high school and she decided to take two of her classes online so she can have enough time for work, school activities, and graduation plans. She has been overwhelm with all her activities and assignments which it made her drop out of one of her two online classes, she said she felt like she couldn't do it by herself which it made her start getting bad grades in her school classes. Later she decided to take those classes in school so she can have her classmate help her in case she get stuck in a topic. I think this opportunity can make students get stuck and give up on school which it can't happen because we are the future.

In conclusion this option has it advantages and disavantages which for some people might seems good and differentes but for some other this option seems to be useless when it comes with the progress that we do inside the school.",3.5
"I belive that students would work more effectivelly online rather, then sitting in a class room all day and not engaring in there learning rather then talking to there friends and being sociable.

When working online the student and teacher has obligations that he or she sould complete foor example a student that has a project due on wednesday and will do it ,on time and correct rather then the student, that goes to school and has the same project due on the same day there will be, more higher chances that the student working online will have it done first becuase the student has less time, to socalize with friends and has more time to stay foused on he's or her work .

Many kids have this advantage and it is a good one becuase they learn so much though out a online school rather then a public school ; becuase the class it more advanced and has for advantages for example the student ;online is taking pre calculas the student can easely tell the teacher what proble he or she is stuck on and the teacher can go over it explaning it in more it also help the student to be more engaging in there learning ; turo details rather then asking the teacher after class and not giving you a straight foward awnser .

Many student's taking classes online have the capibilidy and asset of graduating much earlyer becuase there classed are more advanced and with more potential to succed in life becuase of the parnts and the dissition that they have enrolled there kid in to online school ,rather then regular school .

"I belief in this issue about the students are responsible with their class is favorable for them, take a class at home . Also Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way online or video conferencing. I think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home.

Some students take class in home because they do not have time to go to the school. For example, this e students need to take class from online because they work at night or at day . Clearly, they do not have time to go the school because they time is short and they need to organize their day for take a class so, some students take a class from online because their have many reason . In summary, some students need time for study , and they need this position from online for study and they can finish their class.

To day in the world exist many disease, and we need to get precautions with this dangerous disease. So for this problem some students can't go to the school for this big problem. Relating, this problem with school because the students health is so important. For example, the corona virus is so dangerous, students need a protection, because this illness inflict many death. Is so easy to get sick. For this reason, 
is important to students to get class from online or video conferencing,

is better study at home and also a good place, is the best way for students not get sick from this dangerous disease. However, this disease not have medication, but students we cant to prevent get to sick also, studying at home. In summary, is important to caring students they are the future for the world. For this reason some school need to get dis option, learning from online or video conferencing.

In another hand , i think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home, and other people belief, this not a good idea , students would benefits from being able to attend class from home for this issue, students not leaning in one video conference but, some students don't want to go to the school because they have more than 17 years old or they can't enter to school for their age. Because, for you can enter to school minimal you need to have 15 to 17. Also, you have 18 you can't not to enter at school and is a problem because you can't find a good work if you dont have a graduation certificate from school. For example, some students want to study , but they can't because they can't enter to school for their age, I think is so important to exist a program when the people older the age can study line or video conferencing. However, many people need to get a certification but they can't for this problem, also the best solution is studying online is more accessible for them. They can have more opportunities in their life , they can get a better job. For instance students can learning online , is a big benefit for this students was can't enter at school. In definition everybody need a opportunity for study, for get a certificate from school. obviously the students are responsible with their class at home.

The benefit was school online or video conference represent is the student get more concentration at home , they do not have distraction for any other students, they do not suffer by bulling and they can get a good grade studying a lone in home. For example, sometime students get bad grade for this reason , distraction , they can't sleep at night also, they need to wake up to early for this reason they sleep in class,and they not put attention because they are tired. Also, the students have the opportunity to studying online they can organize their time and pass their class easy because they are focus with their class online also they not have distraction and its for that reason they get a good grades, students need class online or video conferencing , this program help many studying or many young girl are pregnant. Some young girl want to finish her high school but she can't because her are pregnant. However, some school get a program studying online is to much better for this students are pregnant is more easy, to studying at home because she can eating when she hungry and carrying her health for her baby. The program studying online is important to exist help to many students with different problems situations or health problems. In summary learning as action for students who wants to study online or video conferencing. I think is a good program for many students who want to study. Clearly,

everybody has the opportunity to study obviously the students who get study online has a responsible to attend every day their class and get their certification high school.

In conclusion, class online or video conferencing have many option to study, just is question of time for the students , they need to organize time for study online and can graduate , this program no have many different then the school just, the student need to stay alone and the benefit of that is you can concentrate better alone by your self. Also is better studying at home for this many disease dangerous is more comfortable state at home. However students no need age for study, what they need is inspiration and intelligent for study not need age. In summary distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. ",2.5
"Some schools offer distance learning as and option for students to attend classes from home by way of online video conferencing ,Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? There are too many ways to appreciate the opportunity to take online classes ,at my point of view this is a good tool to people who's not able to attend to a regular school or for people who needs more credits to graduated .Some people attend to take online classes because they don't have enough time to attend to a regular school because they have to work in the morning to support a family, take classes online is the best way to get a career ,and get a better job. This tools would benefits people ,I have my own example that take classes online is really helpful to graduate because ,I am taking classes online because i need credits to graduate and it is a good opportunity that some schools offer to students in the same way as me .one of the advantage at being taking classes at home is that you can work and study at the same time ,and you can have your own schedule and the best thing is at home you dont have to travel to other place

. When you are taking online classes you are allow to work whenever you want

,and also you can eating at the same time because you dont have nobody to pressure you to do the assignment because you have the enough time

.

However there also some disadvantage of take online classes because sometimes the students don't use this opportunity from the best way .One disadvantage is that some students when they are taking online classes they can uses the phone and those devices distract them so much,Sometimes they don't have nobody to help them if have any question or needs help with something . One more disadvantage is that when the students are taking classes online they attend to loss interest and prefers do other things instead of do their assignments

,because they don't even care about their grades because they don't have a teacher to pressure them to do their assignments ,but everything depends how much interest the student put in pass the online classes to improve the grades and gained more knowledge .Sometimes when the students take online classes and regular school they attend to violated the rules of the school because they are accustomed to be in the habit of work at home they dont want to follow the directions of the teacher, and they also what to do whatever they want and that is not fear for the teacher who has to tolerate it.

There are some advantages and disadvantage of attend classes from home by online classes ,but everything depends the way that you uses this tools to gained more knowledge and be prepared for life .",2.5
"Technology seems to be becoming more and more important now. As the technology improves year by year, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But people have very different thoughts to this idea, then the problem comes. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Although some think students should attend classes from home, actually they shouldn't attend classes from home because students might be doing other things during the online class time. And students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends if they attend classes from home.

Those who believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. They think it's much safer for students to take an online class at home. And they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment.

One reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that they might be doing other things during the online class time. An example of this would be my cousin, Generic_Name. He took an online class on the computer few months ago. In the beginning, he was so exciting because it was the first time for him to take a class at home. And his parents were happy to see that because it's difficult to send Generic_Name to school everyday, both of them had work to do. After a few weeks, Generic_Name got his first test grade of online study. It was much lower than the grade he used to get. I asked the reason later, he explained he was playing his cell phone during the class time and didn't pay attention. If he normally took classes in the school, I thought he would get at least a ""B"" in this test. He was smart,just too lazy to study. It's undeniable that online classes brought a lot of convinces to Generic_Name and his family, but it was not the best way to help him to improve his grade.

Another reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends. An example of this would be my friend, Generic_Name. Although he wasn't like to talk, he had a lot of friends in the school because he was nice to everyone. But everything has changed, since he attended classes from home . We didn't see him for a long time even the class was over. His parents told us he won't come to school anymore because he hated school. If Generic_Name took classes at school like before, he would meet more friends. I can't say if it's a bad choice to attend classes from home, but at least not the way for those students who wasn't like to talk.

In conclusion, although some think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, I believe students shouldn't attend classes from home. They should get more opportunities to communicate with their friends, and enjoy their short, but wonderful school life. ",4.0
"I Think that no matter if you are taking online classes, or going to school, you always going to graduate you can loarn alot if you'r taking online classes. Like if i were on the position of taking online classes, because im working and i don't have that much time i would loved to study when ever i could.

For Example:

some people that are here in the United States they have to go to school and work after school, and they got to pay rent, send money to their families back in there Contries.

For Example:

Some of the people don't have someone that can take them to school and the school is far away that the buses can not go all the way to their homes.

For Example:

There are some kids that don't go to school, having the school next to them, but there's alot of people out here thet would love to go to school or even take online classes but they can't because some of them are always working, some of them even have two jobs.

For Example: My mom wouold loved to take online classes at less but she can't because she has to work in the very morning like at 7 am, and she comes back like at one she cleans the house and then like at 3pm she goes to her other job and she gets out like at 11:30 pm so she doesn't have time but she would love if she could do it.

For Example: My dad he's going all the way to DC for school because he is taking classes for duster he pays each moth and my dad works to in countruction but weekends she goes to DC the classes start like at 10 and they end like at 1,

if you like someting work hard for what you like.

For Example: I have a friend that he takes online he work's everyday, he takes his computer to his work so when he's on break runs to the computer and he starts school online like that someone that wants to progress in this country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ",2.5
"Have you ever been in class unsure about what your learning even though you have been paying attention? I'm sure that would be majority of upper classmen students. I can admit I've have been several of times, In my opinion distance learning is a wonderful idea. Students can move at their own pase , you can replay the lesson video as much as needed , and it will prevent you from failing a class.

School can be stressful expecially when you miss a day and you feel like your behind on everything. Then when the teacher explains it to you , If you don't understand you might not want to ask for him/her to repeat it again. This can be avoided by the power of distance learning you'll be able to have classes online so you can move at your own paste. You wouldn't have to worry about asking a staff or classmate what you missed. Also you can take notes and do your classwork whichever way it works best for you.

However some students are visual and independent learners they focus better when they work by themselves. Working in a group at times might not always be the best option. When reviewing for a test or quiz you can go back and reread ,study, and take notes on whatever you're struggling with. Those notes can be reviewed as much as you want. If you're a type of person that has to have things repeated to you multiple times this is a great opportunity for you.

Last but not least , Are you failing a class due to not having enough time to turn your work in? You would probably not have to worry about that anymore because you can do your work at anytime. In class you are given a time limit you have to turn in your assigment. When your doing it online yes im sure there is a due date but you're not told what time your suppose to start at. If your at sports practice or have any free time you can start working on it. In my opinion this will prevent you from failing a class because you can turn it in whenever your ready to.

To sum it up this is an amazing opportunity alot of students should be looking to attend. If your school is offering this to you I highly recommend it. It can keep you on track and motivate you to complete and turn your work in on time so you don't fall behind in class. You can move at your own paste without anyone rushing you. And lastly, you can replay and reread anything as you would like with no limits. This is a big help for students who want to reach their goal of earning a diploma.             ",4.0
"Throughout the course of our history,education has always been placed amongst the most important necessities,as it not only helps us learn and better ourselves,but because it also opens new doors and possibilities for us. In the past,schools couldn't offer differing alternatives,because technology wasn't as present as it is today. Schools can now offer education to students,all while being at different locations. By students taking classes at home,they'll be able to benefit because they won't feel as socially distressed as they would in person,the level of education could be better and possibly help them graduate earlier,and they wont't have to endure social issues, such as bullying. Many people tend to believe that because they go to school,they won't have a hard time adjusting and fitting in with the masses,but to contrary beliefs,there's a lot of people who do struggle with social anxiety and overall,tend to have a hard time fitting in. Firstly,an example of this, is my cousin Generic_Name. He does have friends,but he feels extremely overwhelmed by being around so many different people,mostly because he's always struggled with social anxiety. Generic_Name decided that he would still like to pursue and attain his education,so he started looking for different alternatives that could help him do so. After much research and gathering of information,he concluded that distance learning was the best choice for him,as he wouldn't have to endure overwhelming amounts of people,or feel pressured by the constant necessity of having to wake up early during the mornings. Another example would be my friend Generic_Name,who never really had problems of fitting in and making friends,but overall disliked the whole ordeal of the school system itself. She then decided to pursue her education through another medium,that medium being,distance learning. Secondly,what a majority of people don't tend to realize,is the fact that you could achieve a better education,and even graduate at an earlier rate. This is another benefit of distance learning. Many people tend to believe that attending school,actually decreases their chances of being able to graduate early and of becoming more independent from their families at a younger age. Many individuals throughout the course of the world,utilize distance learning because they would like to achieve their educations at a faster pace,than those who are enrolled in schools. A prime example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. He was an excellent student while at school,but he wanted to find a way of being able to take advanced courses,that not only prepared him for college and provided him with advanced credits,but also helped him graduate at an earlier age. Generic_Name is now a professional,with a degree in marine biology. He achieved these accomplishments,all at the young age of 25. Another example would be my other friend,Generic_Name. She had always excelled at school,but she wanted an alternative that provided her with a better education and a chance of being able to enroll into college at a younger age. After much thought and consideration,and much conversation with her family and peers,she ultimately decided that distance learning was the best choice. As of now,Generic_Name has graduated at the young age of 17,and is estimated to graduate out of college at the young age of 19. Finally, an issue,that as of now,still affects many schools around the world,is bullying. Bullying has been an issue that has always caused concern amongst the masses,and sadly,it's an issue that is still ongoing till this day. Among the many issues that affect public schools throughout the whole world,bullying is still one of the most commonly and frequently mentioned. Despite the benefits of not feeling pressured,being able to pursue a better education and graduating at an early age,distance learning is also an alternative that many people, who've unfortunately been victims of bullying,provides them an opportunity of being able to continue with their studies,and a feeling that they are no longer exposed to issues,such as bullying. An example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. During his first couple of years in high school,he was brutally mocked for always standing out amongst his peers,and he not only felt massively insecure, but he also developed many social problems and insecurities. He had tried many alterning ways of possibly pursuing an education without having to worry about being mocked,until he finally discovered distance learning. He discovered,that he could still attend his classes and carry on with his regular school activities,all while being at the comfort of his very own home. Luckily for Generic_Name,his bullies actually turned out to be massively underachieving,so much so,that they ended up being expelled from school. He then decided to return to school,and luckily for him,he started to fit in. If it wasn't for distance learning,Generic_Name wouldn't have graduated his freshman year,or his sophomore year. People shouldn't really be afraid of trying alternatives that differ from the norm,they should always read and educate themselves on the pros and cons of distance learning. As technology continues to expand beyond realms we could've ever have possibly imagined,the future of education could one day narrow down to distance learning. ",3.5
"do you thing stuudent would benefit from being able to attend classes from hom?

I sopport the student should be attend class from home because We do not have to go to School and we can have more time with the family also We do not have to wake up early we can saty safe at home.

SD 1. some student do not like to wake up early and they shoose to take the classes online for the reason that student do not to ride the bus and can early to School.

SD 2. In my opinio it is a good idea to take class online most in this time becacuse so many bad thing are happen in the world for Example the corona virus this is one of most reason that I support to attend class at home because We can do the classes online and we can stay at home more safe and healthy.

SD 3. other good reason that is a good idea to take classes in home is that you mom know that you are in home because a lot of students scape and they mom thing that they are inthe School so if peolple attend classes from home mom ready know the his son in home.

conclution some student do not like to use the computer and they shoose to come to School and other student they do not how to use computer but still doing a good idea tke classes at home becasue you can have more time with your family also you don't have to wake up early to ride the bus and you can do you work at home and take more break",2.5
"In my personal opinion when some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing I mostly disagree. Its not because I am attending a public high school. There are reasons why I mostly disagree about this situation.

One of the reasons why I disagree is because this might hurt the students communication skills.

when you have classes online you are not at the school you are home taking this class so you basically don't associate with anyone except your teacher now since i have never took a online class i wouldn't be able to tell if its better to not know no one or to associate with anyone but personally I just dont't thing it's good for students to attend online school if you are someone that like to work with people and not just your teacher. Other students also might be able to understand some stuff that you don't understand and that they should be able to help you. They won't be able to help you if you not there with them.

The second reason why I disagree and I really don't think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. Here in school we do so much activities connected to things we are learning and it helps very much because if you do activities connected to the things we are learning it gets stuck in your mind. Its also better to ask questions and to understand better. There might be some stuff that you didn't understand face to face with your teacher its better to ask them like that and understand like that instead of emailing them or contacting them through different thing.

Also the teacher might not respond as soon as possible and that might be a problem and affect your grade and thats why its better to talk to your teacher face to face and deal with understanding face to face that's my second opinion.

My last and final reason is that you might get lazy and miss classes since you take it at your home . That might affect your grade too which is very risky if you're not a productive and committed person to your education online class is not for you. For example me personally it will not be good for me because I am a very lazy person i am pretty sure I

will miss classes either by sleeping in or some other unexeptalbe reasons . But also there are people that are very organized and careful people out here that can risk this for those kind of people online classes are good and they can take it because thy are committed to Finnish there education in a very careful way.

Those are my good reason why i don't agree with online classes it's a good thing that schools offer distance learning as an option for students if you have a good reason why you don't actually go to the school but personally i dont agree with this situation.

"Schools offers distance learning as an option for students to attend classes online. Students should take this advantage and learn online. The online or video conferencing classes is same like the students are sitting in the classroom. Some students has many problems while to come to school every day. It is good initiative for every student. When students are out of town or country they can study or make-up easily online what they missed in school when they were absent. There are some students who are more benefit for this are those who are too far from their school. For example the student, while going to school they face problems and difficulties every day because they cannot afford a car and his/her school is far from home. Studying online is not a easy way to learn something, but it is good for some students who want to study. Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes online because Students can learn easily online when they were absent from school , students who want to study in abroad but cannot come of some reasons, they can learn online easily and students who are disable can learn online easily.

Students would be benefit from taking classes online because students can learn or study easily online when they were absent from school. Sometime students who go abroad for their studying had an emergency which they need to go back to their country and they cannot go just because of their school. They don't go because they are going to be missed their lectures and classes and can't make up all work in short time. By taking online or video conferencing classes student can easily make up all their stuffs which they had missed when they go outside of town or country for weeks or month. Where ever students can go, if they have internet access they can study online. If students were absent they can easily make-up work online. For example, If student got injury and nurse told him/her to take 10 day bed rest but student have finals after 2 weeks and they don't want to miss their days. But, student have to take bed rest because he/she got serious injury. If they have online or video conferencing classes, it would be benefit them a lot. They can make-up all their work which they missed. It would be help them a lot. Student would be benefit from taking online classes. Every students need to take advantage of this.

Students would be benefit from taking classes online because students who want to study in abroad but cannot come of some reasons. They can't afford it. In their country there are not such a good education system thats why they want to study in abroad and fulfill their dreams. It is the good initiative which school take it to give online classes. It helps those students who want to study in abroad. They don't need to go anywhere. They can stay in their country and study through online or video conferencing classes. For example, a student, who has dream to study in abroad to become a doctor but he/she has not enough money to go to abroad and study there. There parents do everything for them but cannot make that enough money to send them abroad. Student think that he/she will never become a doctor. If student take online or video conferencing classes, it would help them to fulfill their dream and reach their destiny. Student would benefit from taking online classes. Online classes give them boost.

Students would be benefit from taking classes online because students who are disable, can learn/study online easily. It is the good initiative which school offers for the students who are disable because disable student lose their hope and they think they cannot do anything now. They think everyone is going to make fun of them which never happens. Some disable person cannot come to school , who cannot walk, so they have advantage to attend online classes from home. For example, disable student who dont want to go to school and study just because of their disability. Nobody can force them what to do. They don't have to go anywhere. They have one advantage to take online or video conferencing classes to compete with others. It will give them more confidence in life. To take online classes, they can fulfill their all dreams which they made. It will give them more happiness.

Students would be benefit from being able to attend online classes . Students can learn easily online when they were absent from school because of some emergencies. Students can learn easily online because the students,

who want to study in abroad but cannot go because they cannot afford it. Students who cannot go to school because of some disabilities, they can learn online easily. It would benefit them a lot.

"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend class from home?. I think that some students in our country can benefit from able to attend classes from home, but I would do not agree because, the student can be more benefit to attend classes in school. For example, the students can practice deports that they like, the student can not feeling bored in classroom, and the students can take elective class, or academy. However, some students would do not like choose the offer distance learning as as an option for students to attend classes home by away of online or video conferencing. Just the student do not have other option to take credit for graduate.

First, the students can practice deports in the school because, the most students love practice deports and the school give then these opportunity . It is a passion to make what are you like. For example, when I feeling sad these the form how I can distract me, entertaining and I feeling good because, I can share with other people my passion for soccer. The practice deports can help most students to not consume drugs, or participate in gang. The young need a different world where they can have more opportunity to realize the dreams.

Second, the students can not feeling bored in classrooms. All students like to feeling motivate, happy, and entertaining. They do not like to be all day in one computer, or landlocked in home, so these the reason that the students like to going school because, they can share with their friends and know new people. For example, when I confused ,or need help with my homework I can ask my teacher, or my partner. we can travel to know the university, teather, and museo. We can learn about our history.

Finally, the students can choose elective classes, or academy. One of the reason that the students want to take elective class is because, they can to know what are their like. All schools in our country have elective classes, or academy about: kitchen, piano, cosmetology, art, fitnes, medical assistent, dentist, band, police, detective, electrician, and medical emergency . These class can teach us to find what are you want to study in your future. Only in school you have these great opportunity for know how you can to take a credit in a bank , or how you can they help for your university, how you can applicate for a beca and choose wich university do you want will going to study your career. For example, in my schools they help to know what a I want to study and they help to take a credit for my university .

In conclusion, some students do not like choose the offer distance learning as as an option for students to attend classes home by away of online or video conferencing because, the most students like practice deports in schools, the students can not feeling bored in classes, and the students have the opportunity to choose elective classes, or academy. However, some students do not have the opportunity to going a school because, they do not have family, others have to work and they do not have time or car to going a night school, and do not have other option for graduated that accept the offer to attend classes from home by away of online or video conferencing.

"I think that all schools should offer video or online conferencing as well as online education form the school. Students should be able to be comfortable from where ever they are, and learn in a manner that they are comfortable with. There maybe different reasons where students may not come to school. However, if they do miss school students can have the abillity to turn in work and learn about what they missed. This would be good and better for teachers because students would have no excuse of them not turning in there work late or at all.

Students may miss school for all types of reasons, for exmple students can miss school for an urgent reason or a family situation. Some familys don't have enough resources to live off a good life, so, some students can't make it for school and have to work to support there families. In some cases familys have younger sibilings that they have to take care of, but the family can't afford to stay home and have to work. In that case families make students stay home to baby sit a little brother or sister. Students miss the education they need, and that's a good reason why they should have online based learning.

Having said that students may also be very sick and may not be able come to school. Students may also have variuse injuries that can be hard for them to move in certain areas, therefore they stay home and miss school. students could be in the hospital, and may not return to school for a long period of time, it could also be hard for them to transition back and catch up with his or her school work. Some students may be takeing care of a sick relative and my not be able to make it to school. online base learning would be very helpful to those students that are injured or sick.

Students also tend to leave the country, and go back to their countrys. Families make arrangements to visit their home countrys in the middle of the school year. in some cases families don't come back for long periods of time. Students tend to miss a lot of school work and education in the time they are gone. Online based learning would come in handy in this situation. Students could have fun where they are, and not miss a single assiegnment or a day they are learning something new.

Online based learning is the best solution to students missing school. It would be a great oppertunity for students to get back on track and finished what they started. I would recommend online based learning because I think of the families that are in deep need by the students that come to school in helping their families. I also think of the people that are sick, and that need rest at home. This program would help a lot of students get the education they need without worrying they won't get it.

"Even in classroom everything catch student's attention!

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I strongly believe that there is no benefits from attending to classes from home. Next I am going to illustrate three reasons for saying that. First, by taking online classes at the end of the semester students do not learn anything. Second, students most of the time get distract very easily, they don't focus on what they are suppose to be focusing on. Last , is more convenient when someone is teaching you literally face to face.

To begin with, sometimes students don't learn anything in classroom imagine in front of a computer.

In other words, being at home students will do everything in a rush just to finish it quickly and go do something else. Another consequence is that they will not put any interest in the classes and later, when the time to show your knowledge comes, they will not know what to do.

For Example, in my case when I am learning something something in the computer I feel like the light of the computer blocks my mind.

To continue, is very easily for students to get distracted by something. Taking online classes at home means having access to any electronic device to distract them like, cell phones, same computer that you are using, TV, etc. For example, sometimes when your family sees you at home they will tell you to take care of your siblings; the student will have to be supervising the kids and not focusing enough in the classes. imagine that in the classroom friends distract students at home that will be more terrible because young students always have friends playing video games at their home.

At last, is more convenient to be learning in a classroom where you can see the teacher. For example, In my case I like to interact with the teacher and my classmate about the topic that we are learning, to get better understanding and sometimes to get other viewpoints. Therefore, is more efficiently to be seeing the teacher literally teaching you to get all the knowledge needed to pass the classes. Most of the time that students are learning somethings in the computer they tend to forget it right away.

In conclusion, being in a classroom and interacting with the teacher and classmate is the best way of learning, getting all the information needed to pass the classes. By taking online classes at home the only thing that is going to happen is losing the semester by not being able to score what is needed to pass.

Electronic distraction is more available at home and get students attention very easily.

Attending to a classroom is more convenient and better way of learning and get educated the way it should be. It is not just about classes but also how to interact with people and and everything that is needed outside in the world to be educated and successful in life.  ",3.5
"Students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. First of all, this will let students be less stress from going to school and receiving their education. Students can also work at their own pace at home in a relaxing enviroment which I think works best. Lastly, this would give students more free time for themselves and choose whatever they want to do what they can't do during the day.

Most students around the United States dislike waking up early in the morning and having to take the long proccess of getting ready and parents yelling at them ""Wake up"" or ""The bus is going to leave you"". There are some schools that offer online classes that benefit students from going to school and taking the classes online. I think this would help all students from stress becasue you won't have to think about early morning wake ups. This would help students not having to deal with overloads of work stressing about ""where did I put my papers"" and losing valuable homework. This also helps with time management. Students won't have to go to school for more than 7 hours and be stuck in class sleep deprived and would just be at home taking there time with there classes online. Furthermore, this would help students getting into trouble at school and dealing with teachers about who's right and who's wrong.

In addition, students would benefit even more becasue they would work at there own pace. Students can take time by working in each subject at there pace and won't be rushed by and teachers or anybody. I think this is a great way for students to build self-indepence for the real world becasue they will be on there own and have to manage there time wisely and accordingly. I also think you can get more worked down where the you can choose a place at home or a nearby coffee shop where students don't have distractions. Students can also engage with other students if they taking the same materials and help each other out.

Moreover, this allows students to have more free time and social time to themselves. Many students these days want to have some change in there pockets and find partime jobs. This would allow students to either choose a job or a hobby they like to pursue during the day since they won't be physically at school. Most students can join a sport they like and also have plenty if time to condition and practice to get better.

In conclusion,

students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. I would reccomend many schools should have online classes for students who just dont feel school isnt where they can learn but at home they can enjoy there comfort and still excel. ",4.0
"Is learning online a gift? Students should attend to classes from home because that way the students would have more time to study or do homework, the students would get less distracted, and the students would learn better if they feel more comfortable.

Students would have more time to study, or do homework because they could start school later on the day, or students could start early it depends on how the students feel. Students would feel better if they had a better rest, or knowing they could do school whatever time they feel good.

The students would get less distracted if they learned from home because they are not around their friend or peers, who are usually a distraction. Of course the students will get bored of being alone while doing school but it's better for them to stay focused on what they are doing, and plus they have a better understanding on what they are doing if the students don't get distracted. The students would be more dedicated on the homework's, tests, or projects because they would understand a lot more if they are not distracted by their friends.

The students would learn a lot more if they are comfortable for example people pay more attention when they are in their rooms on their beds or when at their house. Students would rather sit on a comfortable chair rather than a school chair because when your sitting on the same chair everyday your body starts to hurt, or you don't feel comfortable sitting in that position.

Students should have the opportunity to attend school from home because its more beneficial for them, they have a better timing, they are more comfortable when working from home, and they would get less distracted from other students.",3.5
"Although some say schools shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students would not get enough educations away from school, actually students should have benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

However, some say school shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldn't get enough knowledge at home, it's better in school.

Actually, students should be able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. First, Online is useful in many ways. Students can research the information, or students can watch video on YouTube. For example, Math, some students don't understand how to solve the equations, but they can watch the video and find more math learning. Also, English essays. last year, my English teacher told me to write an essay about the night by Eli Wisely. I researched him because I didn't know who he was at first, and I found his history in the holocaust, I read it. It was very tragedy. So, I wrote it down for project, and I found a lot information in the holocaust. It was useful finding information on Google.

Second, video conferencing is helpful. There is a website called Edubirdie. This website is use for teachers communicating with students for education. Students can spend time with teacher like 24 hours or depends on what time students chooses. Edubirdie helps students with essays, math problems, social studies, science, etc.. Also, I remembered when I had a final exam for chemistry, and the problem was I didn't learned anything from chemistry class. Because my teacher was horrible, I didn't learned anything from him. So, I searched to Edubirdie website and watched some videos of stochiometry problem and word problems. Then, I face timed a Chemistry teacher from Edubirdie. I spend like 10 hours with her. It helped me little bit. After that, I took the final exam and I barely passed the class with the D+. at least I passed the class and I'm happy with it.

In conclusion, schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because it gains knowledge and helpful for future education.",3.5
"What would you do if you fail your online classes? Some schools now offer online classes to make the student's life easier. I do not agree with the schools that offer distance learning, because it could be difficult for students to understand the online notes or videos, the students always need a teacher to ask questions, and the student's parents need to pay internet at home. Also the internet is expensive and some parents can not afford.

First, it can be beneficial for the students to attend at school because there is more activities and sports, where they can have fun with their friends.

Also, the teachers are always there to help and explain better the subjects. From my own experience, I need to be with a teacher to understand what is the topic about, that helps me to pass my exams and my classes. Even thought, there is some teachers that are very strict and irritate the students but the teachers know that is beneficial for the students future.

Therefore, being at home the whole time it is so boring because the students need to be studding and not having fun. That is why some students cannot develop them knowledge because they do not take fresh air and entertain them minds with someone else. For example, my friend Generic_Name she is at the Community College and the teachers offer some online classes and she decided to take it. But now she is frustrating because she have to watch some boring videos and she have to take quizzes constantly. She told me that she miss all her friends and her classmates.

After all, certain student do not have their mind clear enough attending to school; now imagine how difficult would be for them to take online classes without a teacher. For example, Generic_Name was taking online courses because he got sick so he could not attend to school for one year. Then, he came back to school, he was so disappointed because he mist a lot of stuff from his subject. He had to stayed after school and he had to go to summer school. Well, so far I have not take online classes but I take my friends experiences that is not easy.

Finally, in my opinion is not a great idea that the students take online classes, if they want to move faster and achieve in the future.

Some teachers think that online classes is easier for the students, then attending to school because the students take them own time to study. But the consequences is when the students fail their subject and they had to take it again in school. ""The more the students attend to school. The smarter they grown.""                ",3.5
"I disagree with the students attend classes form home or vidoe conferencing the reason why i diagree with this online thing is that one of are student will not get on, they will fall asleep and they will not do there work the by them doin gthis alot of kids can fail reason why i say this things because i know students im am one; that me explain to you why I say this .

The frist reason why I said students will not get on because they will be like i get on next time and keep on saying in till they think it not useful at all then they will not get on and just go outside and play with there friends or sometimes there Mom or Dad have to keep telling to get on and they migth not listen to them or just get on there ps4 or phone .

Number two reason is that they can fall asleep while on it and the teacher cant do nothing about it but if we was at class a real class they can tell us to get up and make sure we doing what we suppost to do by going to class that can make the teacher work way more easy for them.

Last reason but not least is that they will not do there work they will get on but how can you know they the one doing it they can get someone eles that they know or just pay them to do it for them teen are bad but smart. However other migth say the students attend classes form home is the best thing they can do because they dont need to do all that monring things they can just open the laptop and join there teacher form the web cam and learn but other cant learn like that they need someone rigth next to them so the students can understand more better. That why I diagree with this students attend schools from home .",2.0
"Some school offer distence learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of line or video conferencing.

I think is not benefit for student, that take classes online because in the video maybeabilities ,and dont have a teacher is not organized dont have partner when are you take the classes online.

Teacher: when are you take the video online you dont have a teacher for tell you what do you need do in the class ,and him cant help in your work for example the teacher cant help with kahoot or quizlet or with others strategies of work .

Organized: when you take the class online you dont have organized, if you need highlights or pensil for write something for read it or explain your work.

Partners: in the class you dont have partners or others people with you, just are with your teacher online, but is not your confidence or your friend like in the school the many people is your frends However; the people can say you cant take the class online because you work for ten hours for this you need to take the class online, but is not bad idea take the class, but you cant work or cant study after school with partner.

Conclusion: you dont are prepared for take the class online worst is a video coferencing because you dont have teacher, organized ,and partners in the end you cant take the class because is more difficult for learn in your work. is more better take the class in the school you have more benefit how you can pass the class and more oportunities that the school have for you ,and in the school you can help new students ,and in the school you can protrude like better student in the school. Also there are alternative of take class online becuase ther are benefit.",3.0
"Distance learning

In century twenty-first the education in United states and another countries became better that before thanks to technology. Moreover, the technology helps schools to teach their students with a better way. Now, classes are created creative and effective. The schools had been creating different programs such as ""Distance learning"" to offer a different option to students. This is a program that help students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Therefore, there is a question that every body is making Is the distance learning a better option?.

As all programs, it has many advantages. The benefits of this program are following: Anytime class: you do not need to wake up very early in morning, you will be able to attend classes anytime that you consider best. No drive: you do not need drive to school or anywhere, you will skip the traffic. Comfortable: it will be comfortable, because you will stay in the comfort of your house. Work and study: you will be able to work and study at same time, because you can attend classes anytime that you want. No bullying: you do not have to suffer bullying from anybody in school anymore. Focus: you will be focus in class, because you will be alone in your house without company.

it also has disadvantages such as no teachers: you do not have any teacher with experience around of you. if you have a question, you can not ask to some else. Sociable life: you will lost a sociable life in school, because you will stay in home. No books: you do not have all the books to study. Depression: you will pass for a depression that could be caused from being locked in home.

Well, is the distance learning a better option?. In conclusion, in my personal opinion it is. I think that this types of programs will be useful and success. There are many peoples that needed programs as this, because they does not have full time to go to school. Those people that need work and study at same time, because they do not have all the resources or money. This programs was created for all you, people that can not go to school. At end if you want to join to a programs as this, it up to you.",4.0
"Why they are think studnets should have classes from home by way of online or video conferencing? Many of the studnets home is to far and maybe can't come or is come let. Every schools should have this option for students. This is make easy for some students.

First,some students wanna to stay home for classes this is good thing because you can fouces carfully and take you time and no body can't make you obsess. Some students maybe just need focuse to classes and he can't do in schools and he want to be school home. For Example; We have firend family him name is Generic_Name,Generic_Name wanted to be home school and do work in home. He do like to come school early. He told to him Mother and Father but they are is not agree with him because they says you have to go school and you can learning better and he do not have any option and he start to go school.

Second,the student want to stay home school they should know home school make your lazy because you don't have any activity to do you you stay home all time. For friendship you can't find good friend. this is make you unfriendly. for the class maybe you not understand what teachers means and you have some question. For Example;Generic_Name she is school home and she all time in home she doesn't have any friend she talk with her mother and father and her mother father is agree with she and she start to go school and she find alot friend and she understand better then befor.

Lastly,some teachers like to teach online and I think this is good option to for teachers because maybe teachers can teach better and maybe can foucse better then in class. Some teachers go to students home for the teaching just for one student and focuse to just one student. For Example;Generic_Name every Thusday have teacher she come every Thusday in Generic_Name home and she was help to Generic_Name to all home work. she talk to Generic_Name about home teacher is good then teacher in school because you focuse just for one student but in school you focuse just for maybe twenty students this is to hardc for me.

Studnets, should go schools this is not matter do you want go home school or normal school. some students have some physically problem I think they are need home schools because is easy then school because in school maybe somebody push and like some accident. For the physically students schools home is good because they can learning easly and they can focause better and nobody obsses.

Some students, need go school for the understand better. Some students need go school because if they are stay in home and they want home schools maybe in not listen to teacher or make copy. For friendly some people is unsocial and need make friend in school. Ithink school good option for this studnets.",3.0
